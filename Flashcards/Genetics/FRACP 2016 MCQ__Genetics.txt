Genetics of Freidrich's Ataxia	autosomal recessive trinucleotide (GAA) repeat disorder on chromosome 9 causing decreased levels of Frataxin Frataxin is a mitochondrial matrix protein. Low frataxin levels lead to insufficient biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters that are required for mitochondrial electron transport and assembly of functional aconitase and iron dysmetabolism of the entire cell.
Intron vs exon	Introns are removed leaving exons as the final RNA product Introns are removed and exons are covalently joined to one another as part of generating the mature messenger RNA.
Which modes of inheritance can male-to-male transmission be seen?	autosomal dominant and recessive and y-linked X-linked diseases can never be male-to-male
Difference between penetrance and expressivity	Penetrance refers to the proportion of people with a particular genetic change (such as a mutation in a specific gene) who exhibit signs and symptoms of a genetic disorder. Variable expressivity refers to the range of signs and symptoms that can occur in different people with the same genetic condition. \If some people with the mutation do not develop features of the disorder, the condition is said to have reduced (or incomplete) penetrance. Reduced penetrance often occurs with familial cancer syndromes. For example, many people with a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene will develop cancer during their lifetime, but some people will not. AN example of variable expressivity is marfan's syndrome. The features of Marfan syndrome vary widelyâ€” some people have only mild symptoms (such as being tall and thin with long, slender fingers), while others also experience life-threatening complications involving the heart and blood vessels.
Pathogenesis of Bruton's X-linked agammaglobulinemia	Inability to produce mature B-cells. Absent B-cells and raised T-cell count X-linked inheritance of a missense mutation of Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (allows differentiation of immature b-cells into mature B-cells). Complete absence of BTK ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein Reduced or absent spleen, tonsils,  adenoids, peyer patches in the intestines, and peripheral lymph nodes.
What is lyonization	"X-inactivation (also called lyonization) is a process by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in female mammals is inactivated. In females with 47 XXX (triple X syndrome) only one X-chromosome is activated (the other is inactivated) thus leading to no symptoms and the vast majority are undiagnosed.    The inactive X chromosome is silenced by its being packaged in such a way that it has a transcriptionally inactive structure called heterochromatin. The inactive gene is called a ""barr body"".   Compared to the X(active), the X(inactive) has high levels of DNA methylation, low levels of histone acetylation, low levels of histone H3 lysine-4 methylation, and high levels of histone H3 lysine-9 methylation, all of which are associated with gene silencing."
Non-musculoskeletal manifestations of acromegaly	ABBCCCD - Acromegaly, bitemoporal hemianopsia, blood pressure raised, cardiomegaly/colon cancer (increased polyps)/carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes mellitus (GH increases insulin resistance) Prognathism - pronouced lower jaw protrusion, macroglossia, teeth spacing, frontal bossing, acrochordon (skin tags), deepening of the voice (larger vocal chords)
Compound Heterozygosity	Two heterogeneous recessive alleles at a particular locus that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state. That is, an organism has two recessive alleles for the same gene, but with those two alleles being different from each other (for example, both alleles might be mutated but at different locations).

Non-sense mutation	A point mutation in a sequence of DNA that results in a premature stop codon in the transcribed mRNA, and results in a truncated, incomplete, and usually non-functional protein product.

Uniparental Disomy	Occurs when a person receives two copies of a chromosome, or of part of a chromosome, from one parent and no copy from the other parent.

[...] can add free nucleotides only to the 3' end of the newly forming strand. This results in elongation of the newly forming strand in a 5'-3' direction.    No known [...] is able to begin a new chain (de novo); it can only add a nucleotide onto a pre-existing 3'-OH group, and therefore needs a primer at which it can add the first nucleotide.

Helicase	Motor proteins that move directionally along a nucleic acid phosphodiester backbone, separating two annealed nucleic acid strands (i.e., DNA, RNA, or RNA-DNA hybrid) using energy derived from ATP hydrolysis.

Transcription Factors	These perform the function alone or with other proteins in a complex, by promoting (as an activator), or blocking (as a repressor) the recruitment of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that performs the transcription of genetic information from DNA to RNA) to specific genes.

Founder Effect	The effect appears in the DNA of one or more individuals who are founders of a distinct population. It is the loss of genetic variation that occurs when a new population is established by a very small number of individuals from a larger population.

Recombination Frequency	Measure of the probability that a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. Does not occur between the Y and X chromosome (sex-linked disorders; results in missing/harmful chromosomes on the Y chromosome)

Heteroplasmy	Heteroplasmy is the presence of more than one type of organellar genome (mitochondrial DNA or plastid DNA) within a cell or individual. It is an important factor in considering the severity of mitochondrial diseases. Because most eukaryotic cells contain many hundreds of mitochondria with hundreds of copies of mitochondrial DNA, it is common for mutations to affect only some mitochondria, leaving most unaffected. Because each cell contains thousands of mitochondria, nearly all organisms house low levels of mitochondrial variants, conferring some degree of heteroplasmy.
