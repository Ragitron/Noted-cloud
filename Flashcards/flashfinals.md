What are the causes of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)?	Sort by mechanism   1. Increased demand for insulin Infection e.g. LRTI, UTI. Inflammation e.g. pancreatitis, MI, stroke.   2.

What are the clinical features of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)?	History Typical patient is elderly with about a week of progressive symptoms. Polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss.  Acute confusion, decreased consciousness, may be focal neurology. May present with a thrombotic event e.g. MI, stroke.  Exam Obs: tachycardia, (postural) hypotension. Inspection: dehydration (mucus membranes, CRT, skin turgor), decreased consciousness, may be focal neurology.    Notes Blood glucose levels in HHS are much higher than in DKA.

Notes  APTT measures the classic 'intrinsic pathaway' of coagulation (factors XII, XI, IX, VIII, and common pathway clotting factors). The assay involves collecting blood in a citrate tube, then adding Ca (not tissue factor) and measuring the clotting time. APTT = activated partial thromboplastin time.

What are the causes of a long PT? (with normal APTT)	Sort by mechanism   1. Vitamin K-dependent clotting factor dysfunction e.g. warfarin therapy, mild vitamin K deficiency (dietary or antibiotics). 2. Liver disease. 3. Lupus anticoagulant.   Notes Prolonged antibiotic therapy may cause vitamin K deficiency by changing the intestinal microbiome (some bacteria produce vitamin K). Liver disease may result in decreased synthesis of all clotting factors. PT = prothrombin time. APTT = activated partial thromboplastin time.
