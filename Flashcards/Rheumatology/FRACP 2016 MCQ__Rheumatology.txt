p-ANCA	Microscopic polyangitis, churg-Strauss, Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN), to myeloperoxidase. MPO-ANCA (as in here), almost always associated with glomerulonephritis.
c-ANCA	Wegener’s Granulomatosis (typically the proteinase-3 protein (PR3) in 95%, note alpha-1-antitrypsin cleans
Causes of Erythema Nodosum	SORE SHINS: Step. Pneumoniae (Also mycoplasma), OCP, Rickettsia, Eponymous (Behcet’s syndrome), Sulphonamides, Hansen’s Disease (Leprosy), IBD, NHL, Sarcoidosis
Features of lichen sclerosis (6)	Figure of eight (around vagina/anus)  Loss of labia minora or reduced size of vagina  Intense pruritis Associated with vulvar cancer splits/ulcerations, never raw areas “Cigarette paper-like” wrinkling
Features of lichen planus	Painful Less itchy Mouth (esophagus) and vulva,  raw areas with grey/red reticular pattern, Wickam's Straie One of the cutaneous manifestations of Hepatitis C
Joints most commonly involved in psoriatic arthritis	DIP joints This is a good differential between psoriatic arthritis and RA. Psoriatic arthritis tends to appear about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis. Seventy percent of people who develop psoriatic arthritis first show signs of psoriasis on the skin, 15 percent develop skin psoriasis and arthritis at the same time, and 15 percent develop skin psoriasis following the onset of psoriatic arthritis.
Strongest predictor of psoriatic arthritis in a patient with psoriasis?	Nail Dystrophy More than 80% of patients with psoriatic arthritis will have psoriatic nail lesions characterized by nail pitting, separation of the nail from the underlying nail bed, ridging and cracking, or more extremely, loss of the nail itself (onycholysis).
Most severe form of psoriasis	"Generalized Pustular Psoriasis Acute GPP is characterized by the abrupt development of widespread, painful erythematous patches or thin plaques that rapidly become studded with numerous pinhead-sized sterile pustules. Frequently, the coalescence of pustules results in larger purulent collections often referred to as ""lakes of pus."" The pustules resolve within several days, leaving erythema and extensive scaling. In addition, marked systemic symptoms also occur."
What is acrodermatitis continua of Hallopeau?	Localised pustular psoriasis confined to the digits
What is mutated in generalized pustular psoriasis?	"IL-36 receptor antagonist A study once proposed the term ""deficiency of interleukin-36-receptor antagonist"" (DITRA) to refer to the disease resulting from IL-36Ra deficiency."
What does abrupt hypertension signify in a patient with scleroderma	Scleroderma renal crisis Also acute renal failure is important. An ACE inhibitor is the agent of choice for treatment, leading to an improvement in blood pressure in up to 90% of patients by reversing the angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction.
What antibody do you test for in a patient with scleroderma that presents with malignant hypertension	anti–RNA polymerase III antibodies (anti-RNA-pol-III) Indicates scleroderma renal crisis. Glucocorticoids increase the risk of a scleroderma renal crisis.
Describe the features of Still's Disease and Felty's Syndrome	Still's Disease: has more symptoms: Arthropathy for 2 weeks, Fever>39C for 1 week, Lymphadenopathy, elevated Ferritin, salmon colored skin Rash, Neutrophilia.  Felty's syndrome: characterised by RA, neutropenia and splenomegaly  AFL-FeRN  Sore throat, hepatosplenomegaly, abnormal LFTs and negative ANA and RF are minor criteria for adult-onset still's disease. Felty's syndrome typically occurs 10 years after the onset of RA
Features of Churg-Strauss Disease	Asthma (adult-onset & severe) Eosinophilia Mono-/polyneuropathy Pulmonary Infiltrates Paranasal sinus abnormalities Eosinophilic granulomas / Eosiniphilic Myocarditis p-ANCA (+) (in less than 50% of cases) Two Phenotypes of Churg-Strauss - Vasculitic (p-ANCA positive) - purpura, alveolar hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex and renal disease. Eosinophilic (ANCA negative) - pulmonary infiltrates and eosinophilic myocarditis
Features of relapsing polychondritis	EENT-arthritis:  Eyes (scleritis, conjunctivitis;50%) Ears (ear pain, deafness; most common at 85%) Nose (pain, saddle nose; 50%) Throat (pain, hoarseness; 50%) Arthritis in 33% Management with corticosteroids or dapsone
