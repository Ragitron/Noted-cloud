Why are p53 mutations only rarely seen in cervical carcinoma?	Because the virus is enough to immortalize the cells.  Then you just need to activate proto-oncogenes.

What is the relationship between EGFR and K-RAS and their mutations	EGFR is a membrane bound tyrosine kinase, which if it is mutated can cause increased proliferation. EGFR blockers can block this, but if the patient has a K-RAS mutation the EGFR blocker won't work as K-Ras is a downstream protein that also has effects on proliferation. Thus Cetuximab, an EGFR blocker will only work if the patient has normal (wild-type) K-Ras. The indication for cetuximabr is EGFR-expressing, K-Ras wild-type colon cancer.
Which populations have the highest rates of EGFR mutations in lung cancer?	10% caucasian population & 35% in the asian population These mutations increase the kinase activity of EGFR, leading to hyperactivation of downstream pro-survival signaling pathways

What is imprinting?	"Where different expressivity depending on mother or father whom has the gene Imprinting means the gene has been switched ""off"""
What is mosaicism?	The presence of different cell lines within an individual What is the clinical significance of mosaicism? If the proportion of cytogenetically abnormal cells in a mosaic is sufficiently large, that individual will manifest disease. Conversely, if the abnormal cells are proportionally small in comparison to cytogenetically normal cells, the normal cells may be sufficient to prevent disease or reduce its severity. For example, a large majority of humans having Turner's syndrome (X chromosome monosomy) die prior to birth. Many of the Turner's individuals that do survive are found to be mosaics with a substantial fraction of normal cells (e.g. 46 XX/45 XO mosaics).   Cats provide a unique opportunity to observe X chromosome inactivation and help visualize how it affects all females. Tortiseshell cats, have a coat that is a mixture of black and orange hair. Calico cats are similar, but also have patches of white, which is encoded by another gene.   X-inactivation (also called lyonization) is a process by which one of the two copies of the X chromosome present in female mammals is inactivated. The inactive X chromosome is silenced by its being packaged in such a way that it has a transcriptionally inactive structure called heterochromatin.
What is chimerism?	It is the same concept as mosaicism, where you have two cell lines in the same individual, except: Chimerism = cell lines from 2 zygotes and mosaicism = 2 cell lines from 1 zygote

Stage I often will not have outward symptoms. Stage II - indicates that the cancer is located in two separate regions, an affected lymph node or organ and a second affected area, and that both affected areas are confined to one side of the diaphragm - that is, both are above the diaphragm, or both are below the diaphragm. Stage III - indicates that the cancer has spread to both sides of the diaphragm, including one organ or area near the lymph nodes or the spleen. Stage IV - indicates diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs, including any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, or nodular involvement of the lungs.   A or B: the absence of constitutional (B-type) symptoms is denoted by adding an ""A"" to the stage; the presence is denoted by adding a ""B"" to the stage. S: is used if the disease has spread to the spleen. E: is used if the disease is ""extranodal"" (not in the lymph nodes) or has spread from lymph nodes to adjacent tissue. X: is used if the largest deposit is >10 cm large (""bulky disease""), or whether the mediastinum is wider than 1/3 of the chest on a chest X-ray."

Add trastuzumab if the cancer is HER2+   Which populations of patients are amenable to the use of aromatase inhibitors? Elderly/post-menopausal women   Chemotherapy in Advanced Stage HER2+ and ER+: Combination of taxane chemotherapy plus Trastuzumab/Pertuzumab, unless a person has congestive heart failure or other serious heart problems. Hormone therapy may be given in a patient with ER+ tumors.       An aromatase inhibitor is the best hormonal therapy to start with. When treating early-stage, hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors have more benefits and fewer serious side effects than tamoxifen. Switching to an aromatase inhibitor after taking tamoxifen for 2 to 3 years (for a total of 5 years of hormonal therapy) offers more benefits than 5 years of tamoxifen. Taking an aromatase inhibitor for 5 years after taking tamoxifen for 5 years continues to reduce the risk of the cancer coming back, compared to no treatment after tamoxifen.
Four major types of thyroid cancer:	Papillary (70%) Follicular  (10-15%) Medullary (5-10%) Anaplastic (<5%)
Is lymph node metastases a predictor of survival in well-differentiated thyroid cancer?	No, it is surprisingly not a major predictor of survival. However, distant metastases increases the risk of death and recurrence by a factor of 68 times.
A patient has a RET gene mutation and a raised calcitonin. What is the cancer?	Medullary thyroid cancer
When do you give aromatase inhibitors for 10 years in breast cancer?	In post-menopausal women with node (+) breast cancer

Serum neurone specific enolase or Enolase 2	Marker of small cell lung cancer or neuroedocrine tumors  Detection of NSE with antibodies can be used to identify neuronal cells and cells with neuroendocrine differentiation. NSE is produced by small cell carcinomas which are neuroendocrine in origin.
