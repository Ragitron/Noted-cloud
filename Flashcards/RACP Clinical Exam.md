Why shouldn't you initiate beta-blockers in acute decompensated heart failure?	Beta-blockers should not be initiated during a phase of acute decompensation, but only after the patient’s condition has stabilised. Adverse effects of beta-blockade in this setting include symptomatic hypotension, worsening of symptoms due to withdrawal of sympathetic drive and bradycardia.

In someone with stable heart failure, which should you start first, a beta-blocker or an ACEI?	A randomised study has suggested that major clinical outcomes are similar whether a beta-blocker is started first followed by ACEI, or the opposite (conventional) order is followed.   Therefore, the order of commencing these life-saving heart failure drugs may be left to the individual prescribing physician, dependent on clinical circumstances.

How long after PCI should you continue dual antiplatelet therapy for?	For patients treated with either DES or BMS who are not at high bleeding risk and who do not have planned noncardiac surgery within one year, we recommend DAPT for at least 12 months rather than a shorter treatment duration (Grade 1B). Practitioners should evaluate patients after the first 12 months of DAPT to be certain that there has not been major bleeding or other important difficulty related to DAPT. For patients who have had a complication of DAPT, continuation after 12 months may not be appropriate

Why would you do a prone CT in evaluating lung disease?	Because the bases of the lungs lie posteriorly in the chest, a mild degree of collapse under the lungs' own weight can occur when the patient lies on their back. As the very base of the lungs may be the first region affected in several lung diseases, most notably asbestosis or Usual interstitial pneumonia, the patient may be asked to lie prone to improve sensitivity to early changes of these conditions.

What is the difference between a bulbar and pseudobulbar palsy?	Bulbar palsy refers to impairment of function of the cranial nerves IX, X, XI  and XII, which occurs due to a lower motor neuron lesion either at  nuclear or fascicular level in the medulla oblongata or from lesions of the  lower cranial nerves outside the brainstem.[1] In contrast, pseudobulbar palsy describes impairment of  function of cranial nerves IX-XII due to upper motor neuron lesions of  the corticobulbar tracts in the mid-pons. For clinically evident dysfunction to  occur, such lesions must be bilateral as these cranial nerve nuclei receive  bilateral innervation.

Describe how you would investigate the aetiology of a patient's chorea	To further investigate the aetiology of this man’s chorea, I would like to take a detailed history including a family history and drug history. Evaluation for the Huntingtin gene (expansion of CAG repeats) is important if there is in fact a family history. In particular more than 36 repeats results in an unstable, expanded, disease-causing allele. The diagnosis of Sydenham’s chorea is largely clinically based as no specific test establishes the diagnosis, however, the presence of carditis confirms the diagnosis. Wilson’s disease may be diagnosed based on decreased serum ceruloplasmin & the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings & 24 hours basal urinary copper. Other blood tests to look for other causes may be required if the above do not elicit a diagnosis.

How would you describe your examination findings of a patient with chorea?	In detail, Mr X has noticeable extra-pyramidal choreiform movements demonstrated by the non-repetitive, abrupt & involuntary nature of the distal jerky movements. I note on hand grip he has a lack of sustained grip. He also demonstrated a choreic posture of his hands shown by finger & thumb hyperextension & wrist flexion due to hypotonia. There were no obvious signs of vasculitis or rashes today.  On examination of Mr X’s face: there was no exopthalmos, Kayser-Fleischer rings or conjunctival injection (which may be seen in other causes of chorea). I do note a serpentine tongue. Cardiovascular examination reveals no valvular heart lesions which may be associated with rheumatic fever. Examining Mr X’s lower limbs there was pendular ankle reflexes. Testing higher centres revealed mild memory disturbances which may be associated with Huntington’s disease.

What are your detailed examination findings of a common peroneal nerve palsy?	COMMON PERONEAL NERVE (L4,L5,S1) PALSY   Thank you for asking me to examine Mr C who presented with difficulty walking. The examination findings are consistent with a common peroneal nerve lesion which is most likely a result of trauma to the nerve.   In detail, gait examination revealed a high stepping gait with the foot held in plantarflexion & inversion. General inspection revealed wasting especially over the tibialis anterior muscle. There was no obvious scars particularly over the head of the fibula. I do note that the patient wears calipers/splints to mobilize. Tone is normal. There is weakness of both ankle dorsiflexion and eversion. Of particular importance inversion is intact supporting a lesion of the common peroneal nerve rather than a L4/5 root lesion. Also, reflexes are intact which are more suggestive of a common peroneal nerve lesion. On examination of sensation, there was sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot.

How do you describe the most likely aetiology of a common peroneal nerve lesion?	The most likely aetiology of this common peroneal nerve lesion is trauma or compression of the nerve particularly over the head of the fibula. Other causes may include a ganglion arising from the superior tibiofibular joint compressing the nerve or compression by the tendinous edge of the peroneus longus. In order to distinguish between a common peroneal & L5 root lesion, a L5 lesion causes mild weakness of knee flexion, loss of foot inversion as well as eversion, with a sensory loss involving the L5 distribution sparing the little toe & sole which this patient does not demonstrate.

The examination findings include evidence of cerebellar disease, pyramidal weakness and peripheral neuropathy with the main differentials including Friedreich’s ataxia and multiple sclerosis.
What is your detailed statement for suspected Friedrich's ataxia?	In detail, Mr X is a young man with evidence of intellectual impairment. On cerebellar testing there is nystagmus, scanning speech and a marked intention tremor bilaterally. There is weakness in the legs with a pyramidal pattern and some distal muscle wasting. The plantar reflexes are upgoing and ankle and knee jerks are absent. There is dorsal column sensory loss with a positive Romberg’s test accordingly. In addition there is evidence of pes cavus and kyphoscoliosis. I would like to proceed to a full cardiovascular examination to exclude a cardiomyopathy which accompanies 50% of Friedreich’s ataxia cases. It would also be relevant to know of the family history and examine other relatives for pes cavus and hammer toes.

Other conditions which would result in absent deep tendon reflexes or LMN signs with upgoing plantars and UMN signs include peripheral neuropathies in stroke patients, motor neuron disease, tabes dorsalis and subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord.

What is your Ix statement for Friedrich's ataxia?	Although Friedreich’s ataxia is a clinical diagnosis based on the Harding criteria, I would like to further investigate to exclude multiple sclerosis by reviewing past MRI brain and spine films with CSF examination results. The prognosis of Friedreich’s ataxia is that of a slowly progressive disease.

How do you present your findings in ank spond?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with back pain. The examination findings are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.   In detail, Mr X had features of a bilateral sacroiliitis, with markedly restricted lumbar spine flexion as evidenced by a positive Schober’s test. There is minimal evidence of cervical spine disease with a normal occiput to wall distance and good range of movement. There is Achilles tendonitis and plantar fasciitis, as well as some evidence of large joint tenderness at the hips and shoulders and uveitis. There is no evidence of an early restrictive lung defect such as apical fibrosis. There is evidence of moderate aortic regurgitation. I would like to go on the perform a full neurological examination of Mr X’s lower limbs to exclude a cauda equina syndrome.

How would you present your differentials and Ix in ank spond?	I feel that ankylosing spondylitis is the most likely diagnosis, however other seronegative arthropathies such as Reiters and psoriatic arthritis may also cause sacroiliitis although this is more commonly unilateral.    I would like to further investigate with an ESR/CRP and HLA-B27 genotyping. A raised CK and IgA may also be seen. X-rays of the sacroiliac region might be expected to show evidence of blurred cortical margins and juxta-articular sclerosis. Spinal Xrays are also needed to look for the changes of osteoporosis and bamboo spine.

How would you present your findings in a suspected myasthenia gravis case?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who noted eyelid drooping recently. The examination findings are consistent with myasthenia gravis, however other differentials would include an ocular myopathy and myotonic dystrophy.   In detail, Mr X is a young man with unilateral ptosis with upgaze fatigability and orbicularis oculi weakness. There are abnormalities of oculomotor movement which do not fit clearly into a single cranial nerve palsy. Along with bulbar muscle weakness there is also weakness of neck flexion, extension and predominantly proximal muscle weakness. Repetitive testing reveals proximal muscle weakness which increases. There is no sensory loss or abnormal reflex responses. There is no evidence of cerebellar disease. On peripheral examination I also note a possible thymectomy scar.

How would you present your differentials of myasthenia gravis?	I feel that myasthenia gravis is the most likely diagnosis, however other considerations would include myotonic dystrophy, Lambert-Eaton syndrome and botulism. However, there is no evidence of the classic facies or depressed reflexes classic of myotonic dystrophy, and the pattern of bulbar and extraocular muscle weakness with fatigability does not fit with Lambert Eaton. A complex oculomotor palsy is a possibility however does not explain the peripheral findings.

How would you present the investigation part of your myasthenia gravis presentation?	To confirm my diagnosis I would like to perform serological testing including an anti-cholinesterase receptor antibody with anti-MuSK antibodies if this is negative, looking for a seronegative myasthenia. Single fiber EMG is also valuable and I would expect to see evidence of jitter with action potential nerve blocking. I would like to confirm on history that this patient has indeed undergone thymectomy as the scar indicates. Pulmonary function testing is useful as a baseline measure, ideally looking for an FVC >20ml/kg. Other screening investigations would include thyroid function tests and an autoimmune panel to exclude secondary causes of myasthenia.

What extra things would you ask for in an exam of someone with suspected myotonic dystrophy?	I would like to review the results of urinalysis looking for glycosuria as diabetes can be associated with this condition. In view of his bradycardia I would like to review his ECG as this condition may be associated with cardiac conduction defects resulting in bradycardia and prolonged PR interval.   To assess his respiratory function I would start with spirometry where I would expect to find a degree of restrictive defect due to respiratory muscle weakness. A more sensitive measure would be maximum inspiratory flow as well supine FVC. As myotonic dystrophy can be associated with both obstructive and central sleep apnoea I would like to review arterial blood gas on room air which I would expect to show evidence of chronic hypercapnoea.    To confirm the presence of cataracts I would perform a slit lamp examination. Typically, posterior capsular stellate cataracts are found in myotonic dystrophy.

How do you present a patient with suspected Parkinson's disease?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with a tremor. The examination findings are consistent with Parkinson’s disease with evidence of autonomic involvement.    In detail, Mr X is a elderly man with upper body dyskinesia including bradykinesia, poverty of movement with mask-like facies and decreased arm swing, akinesia and a diminished amplitude of repetitive alternating movement with inordinate difficulty managing sequential motor acts. Rigidity due to increased tone is also present in all limbs with cog-wheeling due to superimposed tremor. There is a rest tremor with a frequency of 5Hz. Importantly there is also autonomic instability with postural hypotension and greasy skin. There is no evidence of a supra-nuclear palsy, or a tardive dyskinesia resulting from treatment today.

How do you present your ddx of Parkinson's disease?	I feel that idiopathic Parkinson’s disease is the most likely diagnosis, however other conditions which cause parkinsonism such as multiple system atrophy and the Steele Richardson syndrome as well as drugs need to be considered as possibilities. Some of the considerations may become more evident with historical corroboration of the disease course, such as Mr X’s response to L-DOPA.

How do you present your management of Parkinson's disease?	Management consists largely of symptomatically treating bradykinesia with L-dopa and a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor such as carbidopa. Other alternative agents such as pramipexole or ropinirole may be tried as dopa sparing agents. Surgery presents a last resort option if medical therapy is providing ineffective relief of symptoms, and may include thalamotomy, and deep brain stimulation.

How do you present a patient with a spastic paraparesis?	Thank you for allowing me to examine Mr R who presents with difficulty walking. This patient has bilateral spastic paraparesis of the lower limbs most likely at the thoraco-lumbar spine complicated be reduced mobility due to scissoring gait.   In more detail, although abnormal finding were observed bilaterally they were more pronounced on the right side. His steps were short and slow with both legs being held stiffly and showing curcumduction. Although able to stand on the toes and heels, he had great difficulty squatting from standing indicating proximal muscle weakness.   Tone was increased bilaterally with ankle clonus of 5 beats on the right. This was associated with symmetrical hyper-reflexic KJ and AJ and bilateral extensor plantar reflexes. The weakness was pyramidal in distribution, although more pronounced distally and on the right side, particularly weak was right ankle dorsiflexion and eversion. There was no clear sensory level although there was some patchy loss of pain and fine touch sensation in the right antero-lateral thighs.   Allowing for weakness there was no evidence of cerebellar dysfunction. Screening examination of the upper limbs did not reveal any abnormalities. Similarly there was no evidence of spinal tenderness or previous surgical procedures and I did not notice any SPC or IDC to suggest bladder involvement. (Abdominal reflexes are abolished by an upper motor neuron lesion above T9 level, if they are present the lesion would be below T12 but cremasteric reflex would be lost).

How do you present your ddx for spastic paraparesis?	Differential diagnosis for spastic paraparesis in this young man includes transverse myelitis, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord compression due to tumour or trauma, hereditary spastic paraplegia and HIV myelopathy. Transverse myelitis and MS appear most likely as there was no evidence of previous traumatic injury, and spinal cord tumours are infrequent in this age group. Unless there is a family history of similar condition or history of early onset on slow progress of symptoms hereditary spastic paraparesis is less likely. Most cases of TM are idiopathic and presumably result from an autoimmune process; up to half of these patients have a preceding infection. TM is also associated with connective tissue diseases, including SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, Sjogren's syndrome scleroderma, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis

How would you initially investigate a spastic paraparesis?	I would begin my investigation with most urgent test which is MRI of spinal cord with and without contrast (abnormal high signal with abnormal enhancement) to exclude compressive causes and locate non-compressive demyelinating lesion. As transverse myelitis may be first symptomatic presentation of MS, brain MRI with gadolinium should be done as well to look for evidence of other spatially and temporally separate demyelinating lesions of the CNS.

What is your presentation for an ulnar nerve palsy?	Thank you for asking me to see Mrs U who has presented with weakness of the hand. The examination findings are consistent with a peripheral nerve lesion of the ulnar nerve the differentials would include a C8 root / lower trunk brachial plexus lesion.   In detail, on inspection, Mrs U has clawing of the ring & little fingers due to weakness of the lumbricals. There is also wasting of the abductor digiti minimi & 1st dorsal interosseous muscles. Importantly, tone is normal. On examination of power, there is weakness of the finger abduction and adduction. In addition, there is weakness of flexor digitorum profundus of the little finger indicating a proximal lesion of the ulnar nerve. There is also sensory loss in an ulnar distribution over the little finger and medial half of the ring finger.    To define this lesion as an ulnar nerve lesion, it is important to note that the distribution of the sensory loss does not extend proximally from the wrist (as may be seen in a C8 root/lower trunk brachial plexus lesion).

How do you present your dd and ix of an ulnar nerve lesion?	The most likely cause of this nerve lesion is trauma, the nerve may be compressed in Guyon’s canal (which runs between the pisiform & hook of the hamate) by a ganglion, neuroma or especially repeated trauma.    To further investigate this lesion, I would perform nerve conduction studies to assess for increased latency. If there is no history of trauma, surgical exposure of the nerve may be necessary.

How would you present your findings in AR?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a diastolic murmur consistent with aortic regurgitation.   In detail, Mr X had a collapsing radial and carotid pulse character, with a widened pulse pressure. There is a volume-loaded apex beat with an early high-pitched diastolic murmur, best heard with the diaphragm along the left sternal edge in end-expiration. There is also evidence of Duroziez’s sign at the femoral arteries on light compression.

How would you present your ddx of AR?	I feel that aortic regurgitation is the most likely diagnosis. Chronic causes of aortic regurgitation would seem more probable here and these would include problems affecting both the valve itself, such as rheumatic heart disease and the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, and the aortic root, such as Marfans syndrome or aortitis.

How would you investigate suspected AR?	I would like to further investigate with an ECG looking for evidence of left ventricular and atrial hypertrophy. A CXR is needed to also look for left ventricular hypertrophy and evidence of valve calcification. A transthoracic echocardiogram looking at the aortic valve area and transvalvular gradient is essential with estimation of cusp mobility. In addition I would also be interested to see if there was echocardiogram evidence of aortic stenosis. A regurgitant fraction greater than 50% would indicate severe disease.

How would you present your findings in AS?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a systolic murmur consistent with aortic stenosis.   In detail, Mr X had a low volume radial and carotid pulse, which the carotid pulse anacrotic in character. There is a pressure-loaded apex beat and parasternal impulse with an added systolic thrill over the aortic area. There is a soft second heart sound with an ejection click after the first heart sound which does not move with respiration. Mr X has a grade ?/6 murmur which is mid-systolic, loudest at the cardiac base and radiates to the carotids. The murmur becomes softer as preload is reduced on the Valsalva maneuver, louder as preload is increased on squatting and softer again as afterload is increased with isometric exercise.

The most common causes of this are rheumatic heart disease and degenerative calcification of the valve. Indicators of severity are a plateau pulse, an aortic thrill, the length and lateness of the peak of the systolic murmur. Paradoxical splitting of the second heart sound is also a sign of severity. Signs of left ventricular failure are a late sign and may also be associated with a fourth heart sound.

Present a congenital heart disease from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who is noted to be cyanotic. The most likely diagnosis is Eisenmenger’s syndrome possibly due to a atrial septal defect. The features suggestive of this are a cyanotic congenital heart defect with features of pulmonary hypertension. Other differentials would include the tetralogy of Fallot or a reversed patent ductus arteriosus, however these less commonly cause pulmonary hypertension.   In detail, Mr X is cyanosed with evidence of peripheral clubbing. The features of pulmonary hypertension which are present include a prominent a wave on the JVP and a loud P2 with fixed splitting of S2. There is a right ventricular heave and I cannot hear a tricuspid regurgitant murmur. The fixed splitting of the second heart sound would seem to indicate that the level of the shunt is at the atrial septum however other common sites include a VSD or PDA. Eisenmenger’s syndrome develops when the degree of left to right shunting results in prolonged elevation of pulmonary arterial pressures and damages the pulmonary vasculature.   To confirm my diagnosis I would like to perform a chest x-ray looking for right atrial and ventricular enlargement as well as a prominent pulmonary artery. An ECG might be expected to show right ventricular hypertrophy

How would you present a constrictive pericarditis?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who noted increasing dyspnoea. The examination findings are consistent with a constrictive pericarditis with differentials including pulmonary hypertension with a loud P2 and right heart failure or severe mitral stenosis.   In detail, Mr X is a cachectic man, currently in atrial fibrillation with a rate of X beats/min. On examination of his JVP there is notably prominent x and y descent patterns, with a positive Kussmaul’s sign. The apex beat is not palpable and on auscultation an early diastolic sound is heard, which is due to abrupt cessation of ventricular filling. There is evidence of elevated venous pressures with leg oedema and hepatomegaly. In combination with a low systolic blood pressure, this constitutes Beck’s triad of tamponade.

DDx for constrictive pericarditis?	I feel that constrictive pericarditis is the most likely diagnosis, however other considerations would include pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure or severe mitral stenosis. It may be possible to distinguish between these on history, specifically asking about previous radiotherapy to the chest, tuberculosis, chronic renal failure or other autoimmune disease.

Ix for suspected pericarditis?	To confirm my diagnosis I would like to perform a chest x-ray looking for evident pericardial calcification, an ECG looking for low-voltage QRS complexes and T wave flattening as well as confirming atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram may be expected to find a thickened pericardium with marked diastolic dysfunction. Further investigation would need to be guided as to leads on the aetiology. Surgery is the only definitive therapy.

How do you present your Ix and DDx of HOCM?	I would like to investigate Mr X further by performing: an ECG to assess for LVH with lateral ST segment & T wave changes, deep Q waves or the presence of conduction defects. I would also perform a CXR to look for evidence of LV enlargement & absence of valve calcification and an echocardiogram looking specifically for: asymmetrical hypertrophy (ASH) of the ventricular septum, Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior MV leaflet, Midsystolic closure of the AV, Doppler detection of MR and Doppler estimation of the gradient in the LV outflow tract. Another useful investigation would be Holter monitoring to assess for arrhythmias including VT which is the most useful risk marker of sudden death in adults.   Major causes of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in particular for this man are: firstly, genetic which is autosomal dominant inheritance; Alternatively, it may be idiopathic. In this patient’s case, Friedreich’s ataxia is an unlikely cause.

ECG:  • LVH with lateral ST segment & T wave changes • deep Q waves; conduction defects CXR:  • LV enlargement & absence of valve calcification Echocardiogram: • Asymmetrical hypertrophy (ASH)of the ventricular septum • Systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the anterior MV leaflet • Midsystolic closure of the AV • Doppler detection of MR • Doppler estimation of the gradient in the LV outflow tract Holter monitoring to assess for arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia which is the most useful risk marker of sudden death on adults
Causes of HOCM?	• Genetic – autosomal dominant • Myosin heavy chains – LV outflow tract obstruction (most common) • Troponin T – modest LV wall thickening • Myosin binding protein C – onset in late adult life • Arginine mutations have a worse prognosis than leucine gene mutations • First degree relatives have a 50% chance of carrying the disease – should therefore investigate by ECG & echocardiogram, note genetic counselling • Idiopathic • Friedreich’s ataxia

How would you present your investigation for infective endocarditis?	I would like to investigate by looking at the results of blood cultures to assess potential organisms such as ________ particularly for this patient. I would also like to perform an full blood count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate to look for anaemia: normochromic, normocytic; neutrophilia. I would also like to assess renal function which may influence the type of antibiotic I would use. I would like to perform a CXR to look for L or R ventricular hypertrophy, evidence of increased pulmonary artery markings, Kerley’s B lines, signs consistent with cardiac failure or evidence of valve calcification. I would also like an electrocardiogram to assess for (AF in the elderly) or any conduction defects. In addition, an echocardiogram demonstrating vegetations or valvular regurgitation using colour Doppler flow would be of particular benefit to support the diagnosis of endocarditis.  Furthermore, a transoesophageal echocardiogram to obtain better definition of valvular involvement & vegetations would be useful & it may also detect complications such as valve abscesses. Finally, serological tests including demonstration of Low C3 & C4 low CH50 levels, Rheumatoid factor (which may be +ve in 50% of cases) and, ANA (+ve in 20% of cases) would futher support both the diagnosis and sequelae of endocarditis.

How do you present Marfan's syndrome?	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who has presented with a heart murmur. The most likely diagnosis is Marfan’s syndrome with aortic regurgitation and a mitral valve prolapse.    In detail, Mr X has a Marfanoid body habitus with the skeletal features of arachnodactyly, joint hypermobility, pectus excavatum and long thin limbs with a disproportionately high arm span length. Also present are blue sclerae and a high arched palate. Cardiac anomalies include aortic regurgitation with an early diastolic high pitched murmur heard loudest at the cardiac base. There is a widened pulse pressure but no evidence of left ventricular failure such a bibasal crackles or a third heart sound which is important in assessing severity.  Also present is a late systolic murmur over the apex with a mid-systolic click which would indicate that mitral valve prolapse is also present.

Indicators of severity in Marfan's/AR ?	Additional indicators of the severity of aortic regurgitation are a soft atrial component of the second heart sound, the duration of the murmur, and an Austin-Flint murmur. Signs of left ventricular failure and the presence of a third heart sound are late signs only.

How would you investigate suspected Marfan's?	I would like to further investigate with an ECG looking for evidence of left ventricular and atrial hypertrophy. A CXR is needed to also look for left ventricular hypertrophy and evidence of valve calcification. A transthoracic echocardiogram looking at the aortic valve area and transvalvular gradient is essential with estimation of cusp mobility. In addition I would also be interested to see if there was echocardiogram evidence of aortic stenosis. A regurgitant fraction greater than 50% would indicate severe disease.

How would you present your management of Marfan's syndrome?	Prophylactic aortic root replacement generally becomes necessary once the diameter exceeds 50mm and yearly echocardiograms are necessary up to this point. Chronic beta blockade is necessary to retard the progression of aortic root dilatation. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis is needed and a referral for genetic counselling should be undertaken.

How would you present MR findings?	Thank you for asking me to see Mrs M who presented with worsening exertional dyspnoea. The salient finding on examination was  the evidence of moderately severe mitral valve regurgitation most likely due to rheumatic heart disease and no evidence of associated left ventricular failure.   In detail, Mrs M had normal volume pulse which was irregularly irregular suggestive of atrial fibrillation. The apex beat was displaced inferolaterally. There was no left parasternal heave. There was a soft S1 associated with a blowing pansystolic murmur loudest at the apex and radiating to the axilla.  The murmur was accentuated in end expiration. The pulmonary component of S2 was prominent suggestive of associated pulmonary hypertension.  Furthermore, there was an intermittent S3. There was no evidence of LVF, namely lung fields were clear. Similarly, absence of raised jugular venous pressure with prominent v waves, peripheral oedema and pulsatile liver excludes clinically significant right ventricular failure or tricuspid regurgitation.

How do you present your DDx of MR?	The most common causes of mitral regurgitation are rheumatic heart disease and mitral valve prolapse. Although in case of rheumatic heart disease I would expect to find other associated valvular lesions, most commonly mitral stenosis or aortic valve disease, I was unable to detect diastolic murmurs and the presence of S3  indicated that any associated mitral stenosis is insignificant. Other causes of MR include left ventricular dilatation, papillary muscle dysfunction due to ischaemia or dilatation, and acutely infective endocarditis.

How do you investigate Mitral Regurgitation?	I would like to further investigate with an ECG to confirm AF, look 4 evidence of LVH and broad bifid P waves in limb leads suggestive of LA enlargement.  Evidence of inferior or posterior wall infarct could indicate possible ischaemic aetiology. A CXR may show incr LV size, large LA, or less commonly evidence of PHT. A TTE to confirm my diagnosis, assess the morphology of MV, severity and likely aetiology. Also to evaluate other valves for any associated pathology or PHT.

How do you manage MR?	Management consists of symptom control with diuretics, ventricular rate control and anticoagulation to reduce embolic complications. Similarly, endocarditis prophylaxis is important.  Definitive management includes MVR and is indicated if LVEF is < 60% or LVESD > 45 mm. I would consider MVR even if LVEF normal as she has AF and possibly PHT.

How do you present mitral stenosis findings?	Thank you for asking me to see Mrs M who presented with worsening exertional dyspnoea. The salient finding on examination was the evidence of moderately severe mitral valve stenosis most likely due to rheumatic heart disease as well as evidence of associated pulmonary hypertension.   In detail, Mrs M had normal volume pulse which was irregularly irregular suggestive of atrial fibrillation. Jugular venous pressure was not raised. The apex beat was taping in the 5th ICS just medial to midclavicular line. There was left parasternal heave. The S1 was loud and the intensity of the pulmonary component of the S2 was increased as well. There was a rumbling, mid-diastolic murmur preceded by an opening snap best heard at the apex in the left lateral position on expiration.

Presentation of MS DDx?	The most common causes of mitral stenosis are rheumatic heart disease (especially in women) and very rarely congenital, connective tissue disease and carcinoid. Although in case of rheumatic heart disease I would expect to find other associated valvular lesions, most commonly mitral regurgitation or aortic valve disease, I was unable to detect systolic murmurs of mitral or tricuspid regurgitation or evidence of aortic stenosis or incompetence.

Present your Ix of MS	I would like to further investigate with an ECG to confirm AF, look 4 evidence of LA enlargement suggested by broad bifid P waves in limb leads and biphasic P wave in lead V1. I would not be surprised to find features suggestive of right ventricular hypertrophy such as tall R waves in right chest leads, right axis deviation or T wave inversion in right precordial leads.     In a CXR I would look for straightening of left heart border due to prominent pulmonary conus and left atrial appendage enlargement. Lateral film may reveal evidence of right ventricular enlargement whilst double right heart border is suggestive of left atrial enlargement. CXR may also reveal mitral valve calcification.     A TTE to confirm my diagnosis, assess the morphology of MV, severity (severe < 1cm2) and likely aetiology. Also to evaluate other valves for any associated pathology or PHT. Presence of LVH would make me wonder if there were any associated MR, AR, hypertension or IHD.

Management of MS?	Management consists of definitive and supportive management. Definitive therapeutic options include balloon valvuloplasty (PBMV), mitral valve repair or mitral valve replacement. Medical therapy consists of endocarditis prophylaxis, aggressive control of AF, anticoagulation if AF and hx of emboli and diuretics to decr LA pressure and sx.

Present a mixed aortic valve findings	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient findings on examination are that Mr X has both a systolic and diastolic murmur consistent with mixed aortic valvular disease. It appears that aortic stenosis/regurgitation is the dominant lesion, supported by the small pulse volume and narrow pulse pressure / collapsing pulse and wide pulse pressure.   I feel that mixed aortic valve disease is the most likely diagnosis, and common causes include rheumatic heart disease and a bicuspid aortic valve.

How do you investigate mixed aortic valve disease?	I would like to further investigate with an ECG looking for evidence of left ventricular and atrial hypertrophy. A CXR is needed to also look for left ventricular hypertrophy and evidence of valve calcification. A transthoracic echocardiogram looking at the aortic valve area and transvalvular gradient is essential with estimation of cusp mobility. In addition I would also be interested to see if there was echocardiogram evidence of aortic stenosis. An aortic valve area of less than 1cm2 or a transvalvular gradient of greater than 40mmHg indicates severe aortic stenosis. However in mixed disease the gradient is not as reliable an indicator as the high total stroke volume from extensive regurgitation may produce a substantial gradient (as the gradient is the square of flow). A regurgitant fraction greater than 50% would indicate severe aortic regurgitation. In mixed disease echocardiography is more accurate than catheterisation.

How do you manage mixed aortic valve disease?	Generally, management of mixed disease follows that of the predominant lesion. The timing of aortic valve replacement in predominant aortic stenosis still rests largely on the development of symptoms. However in mixed disease with predominant aortic stenosis, as opposed to pure disease alone, concentric left ventricular hypertrophy tends rather than just dilatation. This results in the earlier development of pulmonary congestion and the need for valve replacement at a lower threshold. So in summary, in predominant aortic stenosis, valve replacement is needed even with minor symptoms and in predominant aortic regurgitation surgery can be delayed until symptoms develop or if asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction becomes apparent on echocardiography.

Present pulmonary stenosis from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a systolic murmur consistent with pulmonary stenosis.   In detail, Mr X had an elevated jugular venous pulse with giant a waves. He had a right ventricular heave. He had an ejection click followed by an ejection systolic murmur heard loudest at the left sternal edge at the 2nd intercostal space. The murmur was increased by inspiration and squatting. The pulmonary component of the second heart sound was delayed resulting in increased splitting. He had evidence of right heart failure with pedal oedema and ascites.   I feel that pulmonary stenosis is the most likely diagnosis. The most common causes of this are congenital stenosis of the valve and carcinoid syndrome.   Indicators of severity are a long, late peaking murmur. The absence of an ejection click is a sign of severe disease. A 4th      heart sound and evidence of right heart failure are also indicators of severe disease.   I would like to further investigate with an electrocardiogram looking for evidence of right ventricular hypertrophy. A CXR would help confirm these findings. A transthoracic echocardiogram would help assess the severity of the lesion. A  transvalvular gradient of greater than 40 mmHg in an asymptomatic patient is an indication for treatment.   The treatment for pulmonary stenosis is surgical. Balloon valvotomy is the treatment of choice. Rarely, valvuplasty is required for severe disease.

Special circumustances of smoking cessation?	SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES • Pregnancy – consider NRT if prior attempts unsuccessful and pt continues to smoke > 10-15 cigs/day • CAD – nicotine patches safe in stable angina • Weight gain – avrg wt gain 2-3 kg but some >12kg • NRT or bupropion may delay wt gain Exercise and prudent healthy diet (strict diet not advised)

Present TR from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a systolic murmur consistent with tricuspid regurgitation.   In detail, Mr X had an elevated jugular venous pulse with a prominent v wave. He had a right ventricular heave. He had a pansystolic murmur heard loudest at the left sternal edge at the 4th intercostal space. The murmur was accentuated by inspiration and squatting. He had evidence of right heart failure with pedal oedema and ascites. He also had an enlarged pulsatile liver.   I feel that tricuspid regurgitation is the most likely diagnosis. The most common causes of this are pulmonary hypertension, rheumatic heart disease and infective endocarditis. Indicators of severity are a soft systolic murmur, atrial fibrillation and evidence of right heart failure. I would like to investigate with an electrocardiogram  especially looking for right ventricular hypertrophy. I am expecting a right axis deviation with a tall R wave in leads V1 and V2. I am also looking for evidence of right atrial enlargement with a tall p wave in the inferior leads. I would also like to see a Chest x-ray looking for right atrial enlargement and evidence of right ventricular enlargement. A transthoracic echocardiogram would reveal the degree of pulmonary hypertension.   There are both medical and surgical treatment options for tricuspid regurgitation. The medical treatment is aimed at alleviating the pulmonary hypertension which is the primary cause of tricuspid regurgitation. If the regurgitation due to rheumatic disease, valvuloplasty is indicated.

Present tricuspid stenosis from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a diastolic murmur consistent with tricuspid stenosis.   In detail, Mr X had an elevated jugular venous pulse with a prominent a wave. He had pulsation of his liver prior to ventricular systole. He had an opening snap followed by a diastolic murmur heard loudest at the left sternal edge at the 4th intercostal space. The murmur was accentuated by inspiration and squatting. He had evidence of right heart failure with pedal oedema and ascites.   I feel that tricuspid stenosis is the most likely diagnosis. The most common causes of this are rheumatic heart disease and congenital stenosis of the valve.   Indicators of severity are a soft first heart sound, early opening snap and a long diastolic murmur. Evidence of        congestive cardiac failure are also an indication of severe disease.   I would like to further investigate with a Chest x-ray looking for right atrial enlargement and a transthoracic echocardiogram looking at the tricuspid valve area and transvalvular gradient. In addition I would also be interested to see if there was echocardiogram evidence of tricuspid regurgitation. A valve area of less than 1 cm2 or a valvular gradient of greater than 3 mmHg would indicate severe disease.   There are both medical and surgical treatment options for tricuspid stenosis. The medical options are diuretics and ACE inhibitors. If this is insufficient to control symptoms, there are two surgical options. Balloon valvotomy has been shown to be effective but significant tricuspid regurgitation would preclude this treatment option. In that case, valvuloplasty is indicated.

Present a VSD from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The salient finding on examination was that Mr X had a systolic murmur consistent with a ventricular septal defect.   In detail, Mr X had a normal pulse character. There is a dynamic, laterally displaced apex beat with a palpable thrill over the left sternal edge. There is a grade ?/6 pansystolic murmur also loudest over the left sternal edge. The murmur increases/decreases/remains unchanged on the Valsalva manoeuvre. There is an additional short mid-diastolic murmur loudest over the apex. There is no clinical evidence of pulmonary hypertension, such as a right ventricular heave.   I feel that a ventricular septal defect is the most likely diagnosis. The most common causes of this are various congenital associations such as patent ductus arteriosus and Tetralogy of Fallot; and rupture of the interventricular septum following myocardial infarction.    I would like to further investigate with an ECG looking for evidence of a sizeable defect which may cause left atrial and ventricular hypertrophy. Alternatively there may be evidence of pulmonary hypertension with right atrial and ventricular hypertrophy with R axis deviation. A CXR is needed to also look for left ventricular hypertrophy and features of pulmonary hypertension such as peripheral vascular pruning. A transthoracic echocardiogram looking at the size and location of the defect is essential. In addition I would also be interested to see if there was echocardiogram evidence of aortic regurgitation, often associated with large defects undermining the annulus.    Management is highly specific for the congenital association with the defect but most importantly in all patients with uncorrected defects, the increased risk for infective endocarditis needs to be considered.

Present cirrhosis from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The examination demonstrates cirrhotic liver disease, with no features suggestive of decompensated disease.   In detail, Mr X was oriented with no evidence of encephalopathy or asterixis. Peripheral examination revealed clubbing, palmar erythema, and multiple spider naevi. There was scleral icterus and parotid enlargement, with loss of axillary hair and gynecomastia. The abdomen reveals a small liver with a span of 8cm, with associated features of portal hypertension such as splenomegaly and caput medusae. There is mild peripheral lower limb oedema.   Common possible causes of the chronic liver disease include alcohol dependence, viral hepatitis, as well as less common autoimmune conditions such as primary biliary cirrhosis, and haemochromatosis.        I would like to further investigate with a full blood count, expecting a mild thrombocytopaenia reflecting increased splenic sequestration, and looking at the haemoglobin for evidence of anaemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss or haematinic deficiencies. Electrolytes are needed to look for impaired renal function which might be expected if a hepatorenal syndrome is present. Liver function tests will give some clues as to the aetiology of the liver disease, specifically looking at the pattern of liver enzyme derangement. The albumin level is an additional important prognostic marker. A coagulopathy must be looked for. A basic liver screen including an abdominal ultrasound and hepatitic serology would also be beneficial. The features of cirrhosis on ultrasound range from the early findings of a fatty liver to a small, shrunken liver with coarse echotexture.

How do you do general palpation of the abdomen?	“Do you have any pain in your tummy?” – if yes, palpate that area last and tell the patient to let you know if you’re causing them any discomfort. Do not damage the patient. The patient must be lying flat. If they have tense abdominal muscles, get them to bend their knees with their feet flat on the bed to relax them. Warm your hands before palpation 1. General - Palpate the nine regions, feeling for any abnormalities (masses etc) - Look for rigidity, guarding and rebound tenderness - Always look at the patient’s face to see if you are causing them pain

Present generalised lymphadenopathy from start to finish	I have examined Mrs X who presented with abdominal discomfort and lethargy. The most salient finding was that of generalised lyphadenopathy most likely due to a lymphoproliferative or myeloproliferative disorder.   In more detail, Mrs X was afebrile and  appeared chachectic with evidence of recent weight loss and had peripheral stigmata of anaemia including palmar crease and conjunctival pallor and was tachycardic at the rate 112 bpm. There was no petechiae or ecchymoses. Similarly there was no evidence connective tissue disease. There was a generalised lyphadenopathy involving all lymph node groups consisting of enlarged mobile painless rubbery lymph nodes. Importantly, on examination of the pt’s scaphoid abdomen there was a midline, firm and irregular non-expansile mass along the course of the aorta consistent with para-aortic lymphadenopathy. There was an associated systolic bruit possibly caused by extrinsic compression of the aorta. However, distal pulses were easily palpable. Neck veins were not engorged and the Pemberton sign was negative. Similarly the trachea was midline. The spleen was not palpable and the liver had a normal span of 10 cm.   My differential diagnosis includes lymphoproliferative disorder, probably a non-Hodgkins lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Other less likely possibilities include solid organ metastatic malignancy, infective cause such as HIV, EBV or CMV, TB, brucellosis or toxoplasmosis. CTDs and infiltrative disorders such as sarcoidosis and amyloidosis can also be associated with generalise lymhadenopathy.   I would like to review a FBC looking for cytopenia indicating a bone marrow involvement and lymhocytosis could be found in case of CLL. Furthermore, blood film may show, blasts, atypical lymphocytes or supportive evidence of BM involvement such as teardrop cells or autoimmune haemolysis which can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. I would like to check renal function, LFTs, uric acid. LDH and beta 2 microglobulin have been used as prognostic and surrogate measure of disease volume respectively. A serum protein electrophoresis is useful to document a circulating monoclonal paraprotein or hypogammaglobulinemia, especially since the latter may place the patient at increased risk for infection.   Definitive diagnostic study would be excisional biopsy of an enlarged lymph node. Additional diagnostic studies include peripheral blood flow cytometry with immunophenotyping,  a bone marrow biopsy has both diagnostic and staging value.   Imaging studies should begin with a plain chest radiograph looking for mediastinal lymphadenopathy. A staging chest/abdomen/pelvis CT should b performed to look for additional sites of nodal and extranodal involvement. In general, PET scanning is useful in disease detection in most Hodgkin lymphoma variants as well as the aggressive and highly aggressive NHL variants, while its overall usefulness in the indolent lymphomas remains unclear.

Present renal masses	Thank you for asking me to see Mr K who presented with haematuria and lethargy. The salient examination findings are consistent with polycystic kidney disease causing end stage renal failure requiring haemodialysis as evidenced by the arteriovenous fistula in the arm.   In detail, this man had no clinical evidence of anaemia although there were several scratch marks and ecchymoses on his upper arms and torso. He was hypertensive with BP of 156/88 mmHg and had microscopic haematuria as revealed on dipstick urinalysis. There was a mature functional left radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula with evidence of recent access. There is an old scar at the right base of the neck consistent with previous non-tunnelled haemodialysis catheter. Prominent bulging flanks evident on initial inspections contained ballotable lobular renal masses consistent with polycystic kidneys. I was able to palpate the upper border of these masses and the percussion note over them was resonant. The liver and spleen were not palpable. There were bilateral reducible inguinal hernias.   There were no signs of fluid overload today. Apex beat was pressure loaded but non-displaced. There was a mid systolic click best heard at the apex consistent with mitral valve prolapsed. Screening neurological examination did not reveal any neurological deficits such as CN III palsy which could be caused by intracranial haemorrhage or mass effect due to intracranial aneurysms. Similarly there was no evidence of peripheral neuropathy. Other causes of bilateral renal masses include bilateral hydronephrosis, bilateral renal cell carcinoma, amyloid, lymphoma and other infiltrative diseases.   I would like to perform fundoscopy looking for evidence of hypertensive retinopathy. Urine microscopy looking for, casts, red cell morphology and crystals, urine culture for evidence of infection, urinary protein to creatinine ratio, as well as 24 h urinary collection for protein and creatinine clearance.   FBC to look for evidence of anaemia or polycythaemia. Serum urea, creatinine, electrolytes, albumin and estimated GFR.   I would like to perform abdominal US to confirm the diagnosis and to assess if any cystic involvement of the liver, spleen or pancreas.   If this patient had family history of subarachnoid haemorrhage a screening MR angiography can be performed although in view of renal impairment there is a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Alternatively, CT angiogram can be used. Carbon dioxide digital subtraction angiography could be used to minimise the risk of contrast induced nephropathy.

Present splenomegaly from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . The examination demonstrates moderate/massive splenomegaly most probably due to a myeloproliferative or lymphoproliferative disorder.    In detail, Mr X, a cachectic man, was afebrile with no peripheral signs of anaemia. The spleen is moderately/massively enlarged with a span of Y cm, with no audible rub. There is no peripheral lymphadenopathy and no hepatomegaly.    The most common differential for splenomegaly in this man’s age group are the myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative diseases. Given the presence of a moderately enlarged spleen and the absence of the stigmata of chronic liver disease I would speculate that lymphoproliferative disease such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or Hodgkins disease are more likely. Differentials include the myeloproliferative disorders such as idiopathic myelofibrosis, portal hypertension or an infectious cause such as viral hepatitis or subacute bacterial endocarditis.    Investigation of an isolated finding of splenomegaly would need to start off with a full blood count and examination of the blood film to determine if there are any morphological features to suggest a myeloproliferative disorders such as the Pelger-Huet abnormality for idiopathic myelofibrosis. An abdominal ultrasound and liver function tests would also be warranted to exclude chronic liver disease or active hepatitis as a cause for portal hypertension. A bone marrow aspirate and trephine may be needed depending on the results of the more basic investigations.

Present acromegaly	Thank you for asking me to see Mr X who presented with _________ . Mr X has examination findings that suggest acromegaly.   In detail, Mr X had diagnostic facies of acromegaly with frontal bossing and enlarged nose and jaw and teeth splaying. On examination of his hands, they were obviously enlarged, warm and clammy. There was evidence of carpal tunnel syndrome with a positive Phalen’s test. He had a thickened ulnar nerve. His blood pressure was elevated at ____. There was evidence of proximal myopathy. He had several skin tags in his axilla. On examination of his face there was an enlarged lower jaw, an enlarged tongue and I noted that he had a hoarse voice. On formal examination of his visual fields there was evidence of bitemporal hemianopia which would suggest  pituitary mass. On brief cardiovascular exam there was evidence of cardiomegaly and organomegaly. Examination of his lower limbs confirmed his proximal myopathy and there was alo evidence of arthritis. He had heel pad thicking. His urinalysis revealed glucosuria.    In summary I feel that Mr X has acromegaly and has signs that suggest that the cause is a pituitary macroadenoma.   I feel that he has active disease given that he has 10 skin tags, hypertension and headaches. I would be interested in knowing whether he has noticed any change in his shoe size or ring size.   I would like to go on to confirm my findings by doing some functional tests in particular IGF-1. If that is normal or only slightly elevated I would like to do a glucose tolerance test looking to confirm failure of suppression. I would also like to assess the pituitary gland by testing for TSH, LH, FSH, prolactin and ACTH. I would also be interested in testing Mr X for diabetes with a fasting glucose. Imaging that I would like to proceed with is a Brain MRI. I would also like to assess Mr X’s cardiac function with a TTE.  The optimal treatment for GH excess is surgery. For patients where surgery is contraindicated, radiation can be used. Radiation often works slowly and medications like Bromocriptine and Octreotide can reduce GH levels.

Present bronchiectasis from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to examine Mr L who presented with fever and increasing cough. The salient findings today are bilateral coarse crepitations associated with copious purulent sputum as well as central cyanosis and fingernail clubbing consistent with chronic suppurative lung disease most likely bronchiectasis.   In detail, this middle-aged man with cushingoid appearance looked uncomfortable at rest with RR of 26/min while receiving supplemental O2 via nasal prongs. A sputum cup contained ½ a cup of purulent dark green sputum with specks of blood. Although the patient is currently afebrile, he was still receiving IV timentin. He was centrally cyanosed and had fingernail clubbing as well as evidence of multiple fingerprick presumably for glycaemic monitoring. However, there were no signs suggestive of connective tissue disease. On auscultation there were bilateral widespread coarse midinspiratory crackles, more prominent in lower zones. There was moderate kyphoscoliosis present, which may be indication of vertebral crush fractures due to corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. There was no evidence of cor pulmonale or hepatosplenomegaly to indicate presence of amyloidosis complicating chronic suppurative lung illness.   There are many causes of bronchiectasis, however considering patient’s age, demographic background and predominantly lower zone distribution most likely cause would be childhood bronchopulmonary infections such as viral infections, measles, pertusis. Other causes include immunodeficiency states leading to recurrent infections, hereditary conditions such as impaired ciliary motility, alpha-1 AT deficiency or cystic fibrosis although CF preferentially affects upper lobes and presents in younger age and often grows Staph. aureus in sputum culture. Other causes of upper lobe bronchiectasis include ABPA or TB, which usually causes unilateral disease. Chronic bronchitis and CTD such as RA and Sjogren’s can be associated with bronchiectasis.    I would perform routine sputum cultures including bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal and would review few recent cultures and sensitivities as well as any prior prophylactic antibiotic use to help me formulate empirical antibiotic treatment. I suspect this patient has or has had cultures positive for Pseudomonas which indicates a poorer prognosis. Mucoid strains of Pseudomonas or Staph aureus raise suspicion for CF. GNR such as Stenotrophomonas and Burkholderia are sometimes isolated. MAC is increasingly common, and may be commmensal but are often pathogenic. Aspergillus especially in the presence of underlying asthma raises the possibility of ABPA.   Spirometry with bronchodilators to assess airway hyperresponsivenes and the degree of obstruction.   On FBC I would look for leukocytosis, anaemia either iron deficiency or of chronic disease, eosinophilia (? ABPA).  Aspergillus precipitins. Fasting plasma glucose +/- OGGT. ABG to assess the degree of hypoxia and evidence of respiratory failure.     CXR is initial imaging study although a definitive study is a high resolution CT of the chest. Features on plain chest radiography suggestive of bronchiectasis are so-called tramtracks which are nontapering parallel line opacities, poorly defined rings (end on), multiple thin walled ring shadows (cystic bronchiectasis), hyperinflation is often present and pulmonary vessels may appear increased in size. Changes indicative of osteopenia or osteoporosis can often be found.   Diagnostic features on HRCT are dilatation of the bronchi +/- bronchial wall thickening and lack of tapering (visualization of bronchi within 1 cm of costal or mediastinal pleura. Signet ring sign means that the internal diameter of the bronchi is larger than adjacent PA. Air trapping and mucus plugging can also be detected and general morphology can be appreciated i.e., whether cystic, varicose or cylindrical. CT scan of sinuses is often useful especially as many suffer chronic rhinosinusitis. Extensive sinus involvement suggest possible CF, immunoglobulin deficiency or ciliary disorder.
Present bronchiectasis from start to finish	Thank you for asking me to examine Mr L who presented with fever and increasing cough. The salient findings today are bilateral coarse crepitations associated with copious purulent sputum as well as central cyanosis and fingernail clubbing consistent with chronic suppurative lung disease most likely bronchiectasis.   In detail, this middle-aged man with cushingoid appearance looked uncomfortable at rest with RR of 26/min while receiving supplemental O2 via nasal prongs. A sputum cup contained ½ a cup of purulent dark green sputum with specks of blood. Although the patient is currently afebrile, he was still receiving IV timentin. He was centrally cyanosed and had fingernail clubbing as well as evidence of multiple fingerprick presumably for glycaemic monitoring. However, there were no signs suggestive of connective tissue disease. On auscultation there were bilateral widespread coarse midinspiratory crackles, more prominent in lower zones. There was moderate kyphoscoliosis present, which may be indication of vertebral crush fractures due to corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis. There was no evidence of cor pulmonale or hepatosplenomegaly to indicate presence of amyloidosis complicating chronic suppurative lung illness.   There are many causes of bronchiectasis, however considering patient’s age, demographic background and predominantly lower zone distribution most likely cause would be childhood bronchopulmonary infections such as viral infections, measles, pertusis. Other causes include immunodeficiency states leading to recurrent infections, hereditary conditions such as impaired ciliary motility, alpha-1 AT deficiency or cystic fibrosis although CF preferentially affects upper lobes and presents in younger age and often grows Staph. aureus in sputum culture. Other causes of upper lobe bronchiectasis include ABPA or TB, which usually causes unilateral disease. Chronic bronchitis and CTD such as RA and Sjogren’s can be associated with bronchiectasis.    I would perform routine sputum cultures including bacterial, mycobacterial and fungal and would review few recent cultures and sensitivities as well as any prior prophylactic antibiotic use to help me formulate empirical antibiotic treatment. I suspect this patient has or has had cultures positive for Pseudomonas which indicates a poorer prognosis. Mucoid strains of Pseudomonas or Staph aureus raise suspicion for CF. GNR such as Stenotrophomonas and Burkholderia are sometimes isolated. MAC is increasingly common, and may be commmensal but are often pathogenic.

SPecific directed studies of bronchiectasis?	Specific directed studies: 1. Sweat chloride, CF genotyping, nasal potential differences may be useful for identifying CF in equivocal cases 2. Alpha-1 AT levels and phenotype (especially in white females) – repletion may enhance resistance to lower respiratory tract infections 3. Ig levels: IgG or IgA deficiencies or IgG subclass deficiencies, elevated IgE in ABPA 4. Ciliary morphology or function 5. Nasal nitric oxide level – significantly lower levels in primary ciliary dyskinesia 6. Barium swallow – aspiration, oesophageal diverticula, tumour, strictures, hypomotility, achalasia, hiatal hernia, LOS incompetence with reflux 7. pH probe (reflux) 8. oesophageal manometry

Present a lobectomy/pneumonectomy	Mr P presented with exacerbation of dyspnoea. The salient findings on examination of his respiratory system are consistent with previous extensive left lung resection probably for primary lung mitotic lesion and his current symptoms are due to infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive lung disease in the residual right lung.   In more detail, Mr P was tachypnoeic at rest with respiratory rate of 28 and although currently afebrile was receiving IV antibiotics. There was no sputum in the sputum cup and I note the MDI containing fluticasone/salmeterol.  Examination of his hands was unremarkable, in particular there was no tar staining of the fingers, no clubbing or flapping tremor. There were no signs of Horner’s syndrome or central cyanosis. The signs suggestive of left lung resection include deformity of the chest with flattening on the left and a thoracotomy scar on that side, ipsilateral tracheal deviation and the displacement of the apex beat to the same side. Markedly reduced left chest expansion, was associated with dull percussion note and diminished breath sounds. Transmitted breath sounds were audible in the left upper zone over the grossly deviated trachea.   (Lobectomy: There is a deformity of the chest with the left lower ribs pulled in and a left-sided thoracotomy scar. The trachea is central (may be displaced) but the apex beat is displaced to the left. The percussion note is dull over the left zone and breath sounds are diminished in this area. These signs suggest a left lower lobectomy.)   On the right there are scattered expiratory wheezes associated with reduced breath sound and prolonged forced expiratory time consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   Apart from resection of primary lung mitotic lesions other indications for lobectomy include: investigation of solitary pulmonary nodule, bronchiectasis especially if complicated by massive pulmonary haemorrhage, LVRS (usually bilateral) for patients with upper lobe emphysema and low exercise tolerance, localised pulmonary fungal or bacterial infection resistant to antimicrobial therapy, and prior to advent of effective anti-TB therapy pulmonary tuberculosis.   Preoperative pulmonary evaluation is necessary to assess suitability for lung resection. In general if the preoperative post-bronchodilator FEV1 exceeds 1.5 or 2 L in the absence of symptoms, dyspnea, or chest radiographic evidence of interstitial lung disease, patient can undergo lobectomy or pneumonectomy respectively, without additional pulmonary testing as the risk is low around 5 %. All others should have their DlCO measured along with pulse oximetry. The postoperative DlCO and FEV1 should then be estimated by multiplying the preoperative FEV1 by the percentage of lung segments that will remain in the scenario of the most extensive resection possible. A predicted postoperative FEV1 >800 mL (>40 percent predicted) and DlCO  > 40% predicted suggests that the patient can undergo resection without further evaluation.

Present your Ix of lobectomy/pneumonectomy	I would like to review his recent CXR. I would expect it to show completely white left hemithorax without any evidence of air bronchograms. Tracheal deviation would be confirmed on the CXR and I would not expect to see the right heart border due to mediastinal displacement. The fifth rib is often missing due to surgical resection. The right lung field should appear darker due to hyperinflation especially if affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.   To assess his current respiratory status I would like to perform lung function tests and to check  arterial blood gas on room air. Patients usually have a 15% decrease in vital capacity after lobectomy, whereas a 35% to 40% reduction in vital capacity is observed following pneumonectomy. The decrease in lung function is usually less than expected from the number of segments removed, suggesting that the tumor had already decreased the function of the resected lung and/or that expansion of the remaining lung had occurred. This is especially true for residual volume and is a consequence of overexpansion of the remaining lung. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) usually decrease by less than 50 percent. Diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) also decreases by less than 50 percent, and is usually normal when corrected for lung volume. If the unresected lung is normal than as a simple rule of thumb normal values should be at least 60 % predicted in case of pneumonectomy. The changes are even less pronounced post lobectomy.   Arterial oxygen saturation, PO2, and PCO2 at rest do not change in those patients with little or no disease in the remaining lung.

Present an ulnar nerve palsy	Thank you for asking me to see Mrs U who has presented with weakness of the hand. The examination findings are consistent with a peripheral nerve lesion of the ulnar nerve the differentials would include a C8 root / lower trunk brachial plexus lesion.   In detail, on inspection, Mrs U has clawing of the ring & little fingers due to weakness of the lumbricals. There is also wasting of the abductor digiti minimi & 1st dorsal interosseous muscles. Importantly, tone is normal. On examination of power, there is weakness of the finger abduction and adduction. In addition, there is weakness of flexor digitorum profundus of the little finger indicating a proximal lesion of the ulnar nerve. There is also sensory loss in an ulnar distribution over the little finger and medial half of the ring finger.    To define this lesion as an ulnar nerve lesion, it is important to note that the distribution of the sensory loss does not extend proximally from the wrist (as may be seen in a C8 root/lower trunk brachial plexus lesion). Also, the thenar muscles are not involved in this patient.   The most likely cause of this nerve lesion is trauma, the nerve may be compressed in Guyon’s canal (which runs between the pisiform & hook of the hamate) by a ganglion, neuroma or especially repeated trauma.    To further investigate this lesion, I would perform nerve conduction studies to assess for increased latency. If there is no history of trauma, surgical exposure of the nerve may be necessary.

Clinical findings of ulnar nerve lesion	• Look for clawing of the ring and little fingers (due to weakness of the lumbrical muscles) suggesting an ulnar nerve lesion • Wasting confined to abductor digiti minimi (little finger) & 1st dorsal interosseous (lesion at the elbow) • Comment on a large carrying angle at the elbow, especially in women (repeated E & F of the arm can result in damage to the olecranon and consequently the ulnar nerve.   Tone: • Should be normal   Power • Weak finger abduction and adduction (loss of interosseous muscles) • Froment’s sign: ask the patient to grasp a piece of paper between the thumb & lateral aspect of the forefinger with each hand – the affected thumb will flex. = Weakness of abductor digiti minimi & 1st dorsal interosseous • In severe cases there will also be weakness of the deep flexor of the little finger = flexor digitorum profundus of little finger (ask patient to clasp hands and look for inability to flex little finger). Indicating proximal lesion of the ulnar nerve.   Sensation • Sensory loss over the little finger and medial half of the ring ringer (both palmar & dorsal aspects)

Present a median nerve palsy	Thank you for asking me to examine Mrs M who presented with arm weakness and altered sensations in her hands. The examination findings are consistent with median nerve palsy due to carpal tunnel syndrome.   In detail, there was wasting confined to the region of abductor pollicis brevis. Tone was normal. There was weakness of the thumb abduction due to weakness of abductor pollicis brevis and additionally, there was weakness of the deep flexors of the index finger. On sensory examination there was loss over the palmar aspect of the thumb, index, middle and lateral half of the ring finger. Importantly, Phalen’s test  & Tinel’s sign was positive indicating nerve entrapment.    The most likely aetiology in this woman is carpal tunnel syndrome due to … rheumatoid arthritis. Other differentials include: idiopathic, endocrine disease such as myxoedema, trauma & overuse, or due to amyloid deposition seen in chronic renal failure patients on dialysis.   I would like to firstly investigate this woman by asking about any family history or carpal tunnel syndrome & enquire about history of OCP, RA, myxoedema, acromegaly, CRF or sarcoidosis or diagnosis of pregnancy. To confirm the diagnosis I would like to perform nerve conduction studies to look for increased latency at the wrist on stimulation of the median nerve.   The management of this lesion includes: diuretics, wearing wrist splints & U/S treatment and potentially local steroid injection proximal to the carpal tunnel (not into the tunnel as it may damage the nerve). If these measures do not alleviate symptoms, surgical decompression may be required.

Clinical findings of a median nerve palsy	Inspection • Wasting may be confined to abductor pollicis brevis (thenar eminence) • Look for scars of previous surgery (hidden by crease at wrist)   Tone • Normal   Power • Weakness of abductor pollicis brevis (with the hand facing supine, ask patient to abduct the thumb vertically & touch pen & hold thumb abducted) = due to entrapment of the median nerve at the wrist within the carpal tunnel. • In addition, weakness of the deep flexors of the index finger & of flexor pollicis longus = lesion at the elbow • Benediction sign = ask the patient to make a fist – thumb & index finger do not close or flex. Also called the Ochsner’s clasping test: loss of flexor digitorum sublimis • Test power in the terminal phalanges of the index & thumb by getting the patient to form an “O” with those digits – if weakness present the “O” looks oval rather than round   Sensory • Sensory loss over the thumb, index, middle & lateral half of the ring finger (palmar aspect only)

Ix of carpal tunnel?	• Nerve conduction studies: increased latency at the wrist on stimulation of the median nerve; the muscle action potential from abductor pollicis brevis is a valuable diagnostic sign. • Rarely, the proximal latency may be normal with a prolonged distal latency due to an anastomosis between the ulnar and median nerves in the forearm.  • A negative test thus does not rule the syndrome out absolutely but calls it into question.

Examination of a radial nerve palsy	Inspection • Look for wrist and finger drop (wrist flexion normal). When holding hands out in front with wrists cocked back notice radial deviation of the hand • Look for bruising or scars • Facial asymmetry (hemiparesis) • Muscle wasting – especially in the extensor compartment of the forearm   Tone • Should be normal   Power • Wrist and finger drop (wrist flexion normal) – weakness of: o Elbow flexion - brachioradialis o Wrist extension  o Finger extension o As triceps is normal & brachioradialis is weak lesion is likely to be in spiral groove • Triceps loss (elbow extension loss) if lesion is above spiral groove (above junction of upper & middle thirds of humerus) • Brachioradialis is spared if lesion is situated in the middle third of the humerus (frequent site of fracture of the humerus)   Reflexes • Brachioradialis reflex is absent or reduced     Sensation • Sensory loss over the anatomical snuff box

Causes of a radial nerve palsy	1. Pressure (Saturday night palsy) 2. Trauma to the nerve a. Above the spiral groove located above the junction of the upper & middle thirds of the humerus – eg crutch palsy, shoulder dislocation or fractures of the humerus or radius. NB Triceps is lost b. Below the spiral groove NB Triceps normal, brachioradialis is weak c. Posterior interosseous nerve lesion: weakness of extensor carpi ulnaris, no sensory loss & reflexes normal. 3. Diabetes or part pf a mononeuritis multiplex (or simplex)
