## 6 Ballet Stretches to Improve Your Flexibility

In ballet, stretching and warming up are considered separate activities. Always stretch before doing warm-up exercises.

1. **Barre hamstring stretches**: 
	- Use the barre to stretch out your hamstrings and other leg muscles. Stand at arm’s length from the barre and lift your right leg up to meet the barre. Rest your foot over the barre and hinge your upper body forward to lean into your leg. Then, switch and stretch your left leg.
1. **_Tendus_**: 
	- The term _tendu_ is French for 'stretched', and it is a fundamental move in ballet. However, you can also do _tendus_ during your stretch regimen. Begin in a standing position and extend your working leg (the leg you'll be stretching rather than standing on), lift the heel away from the floor, and point your toes to the ground. You can do this with your leg pointing forward, sideways, or backward.
1. **Lunges**: 
	- Standard lunges stretch your hips, hamstrings, glutes, and inner thighs. Stand with your back straight and your legs hip-width apart. Step forward with one leg, keeping the foot flat and the knee at 90 degrees. Lower the back knee, allowing it to hover above the floor.
1. **Standing quad stretch**: 
	- Stand with one leg planted firmly on the ground. Lift your other leg up behind you, bending at the knee, and grab the ankle with your corresponding hand, guiding your foot in toward your body. You should feel this stretch in your quadriceps and hip flexors.
2. **Kneeling quad stretch**: 
	- Begin this stretch in a lunge position, with your front leg bent at 90 degrees. Rest your back knee on the ground, then grab your back foot with the corresponding hand. Pull your foot in toward your glute, and hold for a deeper stretch.
3. **Front split**: 
	- Front splits stretch the hip flexors, groin, glutes, and hamstrings. Start with a half-split: Extend your body into a low lunge position, then rest your back knee on the ground and straighten your front leg. Sink deeper into this stretch until you’re able to straighten the back leg and do a full split.
