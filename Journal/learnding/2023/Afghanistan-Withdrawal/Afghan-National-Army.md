## Why did the Afghan National Army Collapse?

As of May 2021 the Afghan Army was suffering crescendo defeats across the countryside, losing city-after-city. Until finally, in the short weeks before the US was scheduled to entirely withdraw from the country the [[Taliban]] was inside the capital of *Kabul*, and the Army was all but defeated. 

Repeatedly, the Pentagon stated that the Afghan Army could hold out for months if not years against the Taliban [^nytimes]. But the pressure of an organised offensive laid bare the cracks in the military. 

The army numbered some 300 000 troops, 20 000 of whom were better trained and commited Afghan commandos [^npr]. Suffering critical shortages in food and ammunition, lacking air support soldiers and police units quickly surrendered. Even before this the corruption within the army lead to desertion and failure to re-enlist. By the time of the collapse the Afghan army was though to only number a sixth of its forces [^nytimes]. These critical shortages were the result of incompetence among the officers and the rank-and-file, not just in duty, but in basic literacy. Unable to read maps, or file paperwork these forces struggled to maintain the logistics and beaurocracy of a 21st Century military. As the New York Times puts it:

> *"These shortfalls can be traced to numerous issues that sprung from the Westâ€™s insistence on building a fully modern military with all the logistical and supply complexities one requires, and which has proved unsustainable without the United States and its NATO allies."* [^nytimes]

## Why was the collapse of the Army so Unexpected?

Leading up to the pullout the reporting from the Pentagon was that the Afghan Army would hold for weeks, months, if not years [^npr]. However reports form [[Special-Inspector-General-For-Afghanistan-Reconstruction|SIGAR]] suggested a less than stellar prospect for the ANA's future. 

> *"Many of these problems were outlined in numerous reports by John Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction."* [^npr]

The [[2021-NPR-TheAfghanArmyCollapsedInDays.html|NPR Article]] doesn't point to any particular report and the [SIGAR Website](https://www.sigar.mil/about/index.aspx?SSR=1) is expectedly dense with documents with at most a rudimentary search function. Its difficult to find; however there are at least two articles prior to the collapse that may hint at difficulties. The first discussing the [[Special-Inspector-General-For-Afghanistan-Reconstruction#^sigar-uh60|understaffing of the Air Force]] for UH-60 pilots, the second 

The question stands though, who was responsible for predicting the ANA's performance, and did SIGAR - or really any body other than the DOD - have sufficient information to make accurate predictions.
