This is a bit late for researching but I recently read an [atlantic article](./Afghanistan-Withdrawal/Articles/2023-Foer-TheAtlantic-TheFinalDays.html) about the withdrawal, [chronicling the days leading up to August 31st and the unexpected collapse of the Afghan government](https://longreads.com/2023/08/30/the-final-days/). 

The article itself doesn't talk much about the mechanics of the pullout or how things went wrong. It does speak to the frustration of the US government officials that tried to organise an epic operation to a strict deadline in the face of not just a fluid situation, but one that had no solid grounding at all. The rapid collapse of the [Afghan Army](./Afghanistan-Withdrawal/Afghan-National-Army.md) allowed the [Taliban](./Afghanistan-Withdrawal/taliban.md) in to the city of Kabul to the very gates of the Airport where the US was trying to organise itself. The collapse of the government with president Ghani fleeing the city allowing it to devolve into anarchy. And critically the mass of humanity that sought the only safety from tyrannical rule that it could see in the rapidly filling C-17s on the Kabul tarmac.  

> One question has always been unanswered for me both now and in the past; **why if the Afghan people saw the threat in Taliban rule did they not fight to preserve their glass democracy?**  
> Although its unfair to expect people to give their lives for the greater good the sudden turn to self-preservation does suggest a degree of civil distrust. 
> Did these people not see any hope in banding together against an oppressor? 
> Can this lack of trust only be seen in hindsight?
