# Saudi Arabian Oil

From continuing to [push petroleum as a primary energy source](../../../Daily%20Notes/2023/11-Nov/2023-11-29.md#^saudi-deal) to [lobbying expanded oil use](../../../Daily%20Notes/2023/11-Nov/2023-11-29.md#^saudi-covert) in Africa, [Saudi Arabia](../2024/saudi-arabia.md) seems to determined to be left behind in the renewable energy markets. Like the slave kings of the African West Coast this cannot be sustainable. Or can it, if nuclear power is kept off the table for most nations and renewable reach an asymptote of energy density petroleum may still reign in the energy sector.
