# [Saudi Arabia](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/saudi-arabia/ "CIA World Factbook: Saudi Arabia")

Saudi Arabia is the birthplace is islam and home to the two holiest shrines in *Mecca* and *Medina*. Originally founded in 1932. 

The descendants of Ibn Saud currently rule Saudi Arabia as a requirement of the country's 1992 [*Basic Law*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Law_of_Saudi_Arabia "Wikipedia: Basic Law of Saudi Arabia")^[the basic law is essentially the constitution placing the *Qu'ran* at the top of its political hierarchy]. The current crown prince is Muhammad Bin Nayif bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud.

## Internal Politics

In 2005, King Abdallah bin Abd al-Aziz Al Saud began to modernise the kingdom. These reforms would continue after 2015 under King Salman bin Abd al-Aziz who is responsible for lifting the ban on women drivers. 

In 2011, Saudi Arabia held its first elections for municipal councilors; and in 2015, women were allowed to vote and be elected. 

## Foreign Relations

US troops were stationed in Saudi Arabia up until 2003 due to public resentment. However troops would return in 2019 after domestic terrorist attacks [^wonder].

In 2015 Saudi Arabia lead a coalition of 10 countries to restore the government of Yemen that had been ousted by the *Houthi forces*.

There's probably more context to this: 

> In coordination with OPEC and some key non-OPEC countries, Saudi Arabia agreed to cut oil output in early 2017 to regulate supply and help elevate global prices. 
> In early 2020, this agreement by the so-called OPEC+ coalition collapsed. Saudi Arabia launched a price war by flooding the market with low-priced oil before returning to the negotiating table to agree to OPEC+â€™s largest and longest-lasting output cut. 
>This cut helped to buoy prices that had collapsed as a result of the price war and the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

[^wonder]: what was the domestic terrorism that prompted this return?
