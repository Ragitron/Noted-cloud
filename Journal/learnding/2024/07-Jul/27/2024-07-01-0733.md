From Morning Brew today 

> Researchers reviewed thousands of annual reports from 1995 to 2018 and found that companies using words like “ethical,” “integrity,” and “responsibility” tended to receive less stock buzz in the 48 hours after the report and get hit with ~$100,000 more in auditing fees than firms that didn’t use [trust-evoking words](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/myp?mblid=10127f57aee5&mbcid=35897293.2521024&mid=62863dd0e0383993a0cbcfc374a440e7&mbuuid=XPeM1K2eKoX55Gu7m458QrW3).

In a snippet article about companies that use words like trust in their press releases are less trustworthy.
