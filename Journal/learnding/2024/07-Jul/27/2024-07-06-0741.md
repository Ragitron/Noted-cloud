In this article Sam lambasts no one in particular for the obsession that Australian's have with American culture, citing how interested we were in the American presidential debate, and side-swiping the ABC show _Planet America_. 

While he does have a focus on the ABC and media own by Rupert Murdoch there is nothing of particular focus here. Murdoch's grip on his own media empire doesn't necessarily mean this is the cause of Australia's focus as the same media empire exists in other nations. 

Sam also discusses the relative lack of focus on China and Indonesia. However Indonesia's economy is not particularly large, (16th in GDP, 122nd in GDP per capita](https://georank.org/economy/indonesia), and the vast majority of its exports go to other Asian economies while [Australia only receives 1.7% (shared with NZ)](https://www.worldstopexports.com/indonesias-top-15-import-partners/#google_vignette) in exports. 

As for China, it is still generally considered an adversary, and I suspect most Australian's don't agree @citation-needed with Chinese political and cultural standards.  

While I agree that Australia focuses too much on America there is little in this article that can be discussed about this issue.
