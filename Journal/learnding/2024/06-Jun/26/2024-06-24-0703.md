from _Morning Brew_ today

>  **Genome testing can spot rare disease risks at birth.** Newborn babies typically get blood tested for dozens of diseases, but some parents living in North Carolina and New York have recently been able to get their bundles of joy [screened](https://links.morningbrew.com/c/m75?mblid=6eebf14ef514&mbcid=35797525.2500205&mid=62863dd0e0383993a0cbcfc374a440e7&mbuuid=XPeM1K2eKoX55Gu7m458QrW3) for hundreds of potentially life-threatening medical conditions that regular tests can’t catch thanks to a growing field called genomic medicine. 
>  Early results from two ongoing studies are very promising, the Washington Post reported, but scaling the new type of testing could be tricky: A full genome read (which covers all of your DNA) costs around $1,000 per patient. 
>  Still, research into the cost-benefit of genome sequencing has found that it can ultimately save families money on hospital care.
