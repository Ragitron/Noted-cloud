## To _Mr._ Edward Northey, of 
## Hackney 

Sir,  
I here present you with a _Method_ of making _Common-Places_, for which I need make no Apology, when I shall have told you that it was writ by that Great Master of Reason and Method, the late Learned Mr. _Lock_. 

I know very well that nothing of that Great Man's can fail of meeting with a kind reception from you, who have so often expressed the pleasure and advantage you receive from his _Writings_, and I make no doubt but this _Method_ will have its share in your esteem, by being observed in the future course of you studies. 

I shall forbear saying any thing of the usefullness of _Common-Places_ in general, it being foreign to my present purpose, neither is it my business here to relate how fabourably the learned, both ancient and modern, have spoken of them, and with what successs they have us'd 'em. 

It will be abundantly sufficient toward their recommendation if I tell you that _Tully_ was one among the former, and Mr. _Lock_ among the latter. 

But I shall refer you to what I have extracted from the very learned _Monsieue le Clerc_ concerning this matter. 

It may be expected that I should giv some account of this _Method_ all that I shall say at present is, that Mr. _Lock_ having drawn it up during his travels abroad, communicated it to several of his friends, who mightily importun'd him to make if public, but he for a long time declin'd it, (for reasons which you will find in his _Epistle_ prefixed tot this treatise) till at last, in compliance with their repeated requests, he gace it to _Monsieur le Clerc_, who in the Year 1686 publish'd it in _French_, in the second tome of the _Bibliotheque Universelle_. 

This _Method_ having met with general approbation from the learned, I though it a pity that any thing of Mr. _Lock_'s should be hid from any of his country-men, in an unkown tongue: I have therefore made it speak _English_, and taken the freedom of dedicating it to you, with the addition of two letter, (because of their public life) containing an extraordinary and most usefull method how to _Teach_ deaf and dumb folks to speak and write a language, invented by that Great Man _John Wallis_, Dr in _Divinity_, _Geometry_ Professor in _Oxford_, and Fellow of the _Royal Society_: 
Who, let it be recorded to his immortal honou, was the first in _England_ that made _Art_ supply the defects of _Nature_, in learning person that were deaf and dumb to speak and write distinctly and intelligibly. 
The method that the Doctor prescribes is so plain, familiar and demonstrative, that any person of common ingenuity may attain this art with ease, and abundance of pleasure. 

But I am afrain, Sir, I have been too tedious, therefore I shall only add this, may you go on, ad you have already begun, to cultivate a strict friendship with virtue and learning, and while many young gentlemen mind nought but the gratifying their foolish inclination, may you pursue the rational pleasure of the mind, whose fruits are solid joy and comfort, incited thereto on the one hand by the good example of you worthy parent, as on the other by that of your very L:earned _Uncle_, who so gloriously adorns the great _Poft_ he is in. 

This, Sir, is the hearty wish and desire of

**your friend and most humble servant**

# Monsieur _Le Clerc_'s character of Mr. _Lock_'s method, 
## with his advice about the use of Common-Places. 

In all sort of learn, and especially in the study of languages, the memory is the treasury of store-house, but the judgement the dispoer, which ranges in order whatever it hath drawn from the memory:
But left the memory should be oppressed, overburned by too many things, order and method are to be called in to its assistance.
So that when we extract any thing out of an author which is like to be of future use, we may be able to find it without any trouble.
For it would be to little purpose to spend our time in reading of books, if we could not apply what we read to our use. 
It would be just for all the world as serviceable as a great deal of household-stuff, when if we wanted any particular thing could not tell where to find it. ^[Columella out of Cicero, L. 12 Capo. 11]It is an old saying, that that is the truest poverty, when if you have occasion for any thing, you can't use it, because you know not where 'tis laid.
May have wrote much on this subject, and I have made trial of them, but I have never met with a better and more easy method, than that which I received from ^[he speaks of this methord of Mr. _Lock_'s]friend, and published in french some time since. 

And I have fround, upon several years experience, this method, which is very well adapted, not only to the latin, but also the green tongu, to be extraordinary useful. 
Neither do I ever look upon my latin or greek collections, but I call to mind the kindnesss of that excellent and learned person, who taught me that method. 

At the entrance indeed upon any study, when the judgement is not sufficiently confirmed, not the stock of knowledge over large, so that the students are not very well acquainted with what is worth collecting, scarce any thing is extracted, but what whill be useful but for a little while, because as the judgement grows ripe, those things are despised which before were had in esteem.
Yet it is of service to have collection of this kind, both that students may learn the art of putting things in order, as also the better retain what they read. 

But here are two things carefully to be observed, the first is, that we extract only those things which are choice and excellent, either for the matter itself, or else for the elegancy of the expression, and not what comes next, for that labour would abate our desire to go on with our reading, neither are we to think that all those things are to be writ out which are called &Gamma;&upsilon;&omega;&mu;&alpha;&iota;, or sentences. 
Those things alone are to be picked out, which we cannot so readily call to mind, or for which we should want proper words and expressions. 
For instance, although the story in that place of _Virgil_ where these words are, 

> _Discite Justitiam moniti, &amp; non temner Divos._

> Being warned, by all these things, learn to do that which is just, and not to despise the Gods, 

is worth taking notice of, yet I would not have you write these words down, because there is nothing in the thing itself, or in the manner of expression, that is above the reach of any ordinary capacity. 

The second thing which I would have taken notice of, is, that you don't write out too much, but only what is most worthy of observation, and to mark the place of the author from whence you extract it, for otherwise it will cause the loss of too much time. 

Neither ought any thing be collected whilst you are busied in reading, if by taking the pen hand the thread of you reading be broken off, for that make the reading both tedious and unpleasant. 

The places we design to extract from are to be marked down upon a piece of paper, that we may do it after have read the book out, neither is it to be done just after the first reading over of the book, but when we have read it a second time. 

These things it's likely may seem minute and trivial, but without 'em great things cannot subsist, and these being neglected cause very great confusion both of memory and judgement, and that which above all things is most to be valued, loss of time. 

Some who otherwise were men of most extraordinary parts, by the neglect of these things have committed great errors, which if they have been so happy as to have avoided, they would have been much more serviceable to the learned world, and so consequently to mankind. 

And in good truth, they who depsise such things, do it not for much from any greater share of wit that they have than their neighbours, as from want of judgement, whence it is that they do not well understand how useful things order and method are.

# Mr. _Lock_'s letter to Monsieur Toinard,
## containing a new and easy method of making Common-Place Books, an exact index of which may be made in two pages. 

I do at length, Sir, obey you in publishing my method of making _Common-Place Books_. 
I am ashamed that I should be so backward in complying with your desire, but that which you requested of me seemed to me a thing so inconsiderable, that I though it not worthy of public view, especially in an age so abounding with fine inventions as ours. 

You know that I voluntarily communicated this method to you, as I have done to many others, to whom I believed it would not be unacceptable. 
It was not then, as if I designed it for my own private use alone, that I have hitherto refused the making of it public.
I was of opinion, that the respect which one ought to have for the public, would not suffer me to present it with an invention of so small an importance, but the obligation which you have laid me under, and our common friendship, do not permit me any longer to decline the following your advice. 
Your last, Sir, has wholly determined me, and I believe that I ought not to stick at the publishing my method since you tell; me that you have found it very useful after trial of several years, as well as those of your friends, to whom you have communicated it. 
It is needless for me here to relate what profit I myself have reaped by the use of it for above twenty years.

I have sufficiently entertained you with it when I was at _Paris_, about seven or eight years ago, while I might have received great benefit by your learned and agreeable conversation. 
All the advantage that I aim at from this writing is publicly to testify the esteem and respect that I have for you, and to declare much I am, Sir, your, etc.

 _Before we come to the matter in hand, it may not be amiss to remark, that this method is put in the same order that the collection ought to be put in. 
You will perceive by the reading of that whcih follows what the heads mean, which you see at the top of the back of every leaf, and at the bottom of this page._

**Ebionites**. 
> In the gospel of the _Ebionites_, which they called the gospel according to the _Hebrews_, the history which is in _Matthew XIX_. 16. and the following ones, was thus altered,
> one of the rich men said unto him, Master, _What good thing must I do that I may have Eternal Life?_ Jesus said under him, _obey the law and the prophets._
> He answered, _I have done it_, Jesus said unto him, _go sell_ \[14.] 

I take a white paper book of what size I think fit, I divide the two first pages which face one another, by parallel line, into five and twenty equal parts, with black lead, after that, I cut them perpendicularly by other line, which I draw from the top of the page to the bottom, as you may see in the table or index, which I have put before this writing \[not presented here]. 
Afterwards I mark with Ink every fifth line of the twenty five that I just now spoke of. 

> _The other lines are made with red lead, but for conveniency one may make them with black lead, which is better for use than read lead._ 

I put at the  beginning of every fifth space, or before the middle, one of the twenty letters which are designed for this use, and a little farther in every space, one of the vowels in their natural order. 
This is the index or table of the whole volume, be it of what size soever. 

The index being thus made, I mark out, in the other pages of the book, the margin with black lead, I make it about the bigness of an inch, or a little bigger, if the volume be in folio, but in a less volume the margin is propotionably less also. 

If I would but any thing in my common place book, I look a _Head_ to which I may refer it, that I be able to find it when I have occasion. 
Every _Head_ ought to begin with some considerable word that is essential to the matter treated of, and of this word one must carefully observe the first letter, and the vowel which follows it, for upon these two letters depends the whol use of our index. 

I leave out three letters of the alphabet as useless, to wit, K, Y, W, which are supplied by C, I, U, letters of a like power. I put the letter Q, which is always followed by an U in the fifth space of Z. 
By this throwing of the Letter Q into the last space of my index, I preserve its uniformity, and do not all shorten the length of it:
For it very seldom happens that one meets with an _Head_ that begins with Z, U, and I have not found so much as one for the space of five and twenty years, during which time I have made use of this method. 
Yet nevertheless, if it be needful, nothing will hinder but that you may put it in the same space with Q U, provided you make some sort of distinction

But one may, for more exactness, assign to a Q a place at the bottom of the index, which I have done formerly.

When I meet with any thing worth putting into my common-place-book, I presently look for a proper _Head_. Suppose, for example the _Head_ were _Epistle_; I look in the index the first letter with the vowel that follows, which in this case are EI. 
If there is found any number in the space marked EI, that shows me the space designed for words which begin with E, and whose vowel that immediately follows is I, I must refer to the word _Epistle_ in that page what I have to take notice of. I write the _Head_ in pretty large letter, so that the principal word is found in the margin, and I continue the line in writing on what I have to remark. 
I constantly observe this method, that nought but the _Head_ appear in the margin, and go on without carrying the line again into the margin. When on has thus preserved the margin clear, the _Heads_ present themselves at first sight.


If in the index I find no number in the space E I, I look in my book the first backside of the page that I find blank, which backside in a book where is nothing else but the index, must be the second page. I write then in my index after E I that number 2, and the _Head_ **EPISTLE** at the top of the margin of the second page, and all that is to be put under this head in the same page, as you see I have done in the second page of this writing.
Since that class E I dose solely take up the second and third page, one may make use of those pages only for words which begin with E, and whose next vowel is I, as _Epicurus_, ^[see the bottom of the third page.]_Ebionites_, _Epigram_, _Edict_, etc.
The reason why I always begin at the top of the back of the page, and that I assign to one calss the two pages which face one another, rather than a whole leaf, is that the _Heads_ of this class may appear all at once, otherwise you must be at the trouble of turning over the leaf. 

Whensoever I would write a new _Head_, in my Common-Place-Book, I look presently in my index for the characteristic letters of the word, and I see by the number which follows them where the page assigned to the calss of this _Head_ is. 
But if there be no number to be found, I must look the first back of the next blank page. I marks its number in the index and so I preserve this page with the right side of the following leaf, for this new class. 
Let the word be for example _Adversaria_, if I see no number in the space A E, I look the first empty back of a leaf, which finding in the fourth page, I put in the space A E the number 4, and in the 4th page the _Head_ _Adversaria_, with all that ought to be put under this _Head_, as I have already done. 

After that, this fourth page with the fifth that follows it, is reserved for the class A E, that is to say for _Heads_ which begin with A and where the following vowel in the word is E, as _Agesilaus_, _Aeheron_, _Anger_, etc. 

When the two pages designed for this _Head_ are quite full, then look for the back of the next blank page:
If it is that which immediately follows, I write at the bottom of the margin in the page that I have left filled up, the letter V, that is _verte_, _turn over_; 
and likewise at the top fo the page following. 
If the pages which immediately follow are already taken up by the other classe, I write at the bottom of the page last filled up the number of the next back of the page. 
I set down again that _Head_ of which it treats, under which I go on to write what I have to put into my _Common-Place-Book_, as if it were in the same page. 
At the top of this new back I set down also the number of the page which has been last filled up. 
By these numbers, which refer to one another, the 1st of which is at the end of one page, and the 2nd at the beginning of another, one reads the matter which is separated as well as if there was nothing between them. 
For by this reciprical reference of numbers, one turns over as one leaf all those which are between them, as if they were joined together. 
You have an example of it in the third and fourteenth pages. 

Every time I put a number at the bottom of a page, I put it also in the index; but when I put only V, I make no alteration in the index; the reason of which you will learn by use. 

If the principal word of the _Head_ be a monosyllable, (or a word of one syllable) and begins with a vowel, this vowel is at the same time both the first letter of the word, and the characteristic vowel; so I write the word _Art_ in A a, and Elf in E e. 

It may be seen by what I have said, that one is to begin to write every class of words on the back of the page. It may from thence happen that the backs of the pages may be full, while there may be ^[See the fifteenth, seventeenth, and nineteenth pages, etc.] right sides enough which do yet remain empty. 
If you have a mind then to fill the book, you may assign these right side, which are yet entirely blank, to new classe. 

If any one thinks that these hundred classes are not sufficient to take in all sorts of subjects without confusion, he may, following the same method, increase the number to five hundred, by add a vowel. 
But having tried both the one and the other method, I prefer the former, and use will convince those that shall make trial of it that it is sufficient for all subjects, especially if they have a book for every science, in which they make their collection, or at least two, for the two _Heads_, to which we may refer all our knowledge, to wit, _Moral_ and _Natural Philosophy_. 

One may also add to them a third book, which you may call the _Science_, or _Knowledge of Signs_, which respects the use of words, and is of far large extent than the ordinary critical art. 

As for the language in which on ought to express the title, I believe the latin tongue to be most convenient, provided one always observes the nominative case, least in dissyllable, (or words of two syllables) or in monosyllables which begin with a vowel, the change which happens in the oblique cases should cause confusion it doe not much matter what language you make use of, provided you do not mix the _Heads_ of different languages together. 

To remark a place in a an author from whom I would collect any thing I make use of this method:
Before I write any thing I put the name of my author in my _Common-Place-Book_, and under that name, the title of the treatise I am reading, the volume, the time and place of the edition, and (what ought never be omitted) the number of the pages that the whole book contains. 
For example, I put in the class M. A. _Marshami Canon Chronicus_, _&AElig;gyptiacus_, _Gr&aelig;cus_, &amp; _Disquisitiones_, _Fol. Lond._ 1672 p. 626. 
This number of the pages serves me for the future to mark the particular treatise of the author and the edition that I make use of. 
I have no more need to the place otherwise, than by putting in the number of the page from whence I have collected what I have writ over the number of pages of the whole volume. 
You will see an example of it in _Acherusia_, where the number 259 is over the number 626, that is say the number of pages where the place is that is treated of, over the number of the pages of all the volume. 
So I not only avoid the trouble of writing _Canon, etc_ but I can also, by the help of the _Rule of Three_, find the same passage in any other edition whatever, by looking the number of pages that the edition I have not made use of contains; since the edition which I have used having 626 pages, hath given me 259. 
I confess one does not always hit upon the very page, because of the spaces which may be made in different editions, which are not always proportionably equal; but nevertheless you are never very far off of the page; and it is much better to find out the passage within some few pages of the place, than to be at the trouble of turning over the whole book to find it; as you must do if the book has no index, or where the index is not very correct. 

**Acherusia**.
> _Pratum, ficta mortuorum habitatio est locu prope Memphim, juxt paludem, quam vocant Acherusiam, etc_. 
This is a passage taken of the first book of _Diodus Siculus_, the sense of which is this:
The fields where they feign the habitation of the dead to be, is a place not far from _Memphis_, near the marsh called _Acherusia_, where there are most delightful fields, with lakes and woods of lotus and calamus.
> 
> It is not without reason then that _Orpheus_ says the dead inhabit those place, because it is there that the most and greatest solemnities of the &AElig;gyptians are celebrated; they carry the dead over the river _Nile_, and the marsh _Acherusia_, and lay them in subterraneous vaults. 
>
> There are other stories among the _Grecians_ concerning the shades below, which are very like those stories which are invented at this day in &AElig;gypt. 
> For they call the boat which carries over the dead _Daris_ and a piece of money is given to the waterman for his passsage, whose name in the language of that country is called _Charon_+. 
> Not far from this place there is the temple of _Gloomy Hecate_, also the gates of _Cocytus_ and _Lethe_, shut up with great brazen bars; there are also other gates, called the Gates of Truth, before which stand the statue of justice without an Head. _Marsham_ $\frac{259}{626}$

**Ebionites**
> _Sell all that thou hast, and give it to the poor, then come and follow me_: 
> But at that the rich man began to scratch his head, and was not at all pleased with the advice that Jesus gave him.
> And the Lord said unto him, _how say you I have fulfiulled the Law and the Prophets, since it is written in the Law, thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy self; and lo there are many of thy brethren, the children of Abraham, who have bad raimant, and die with hunger, while no help is administered to them from you, tho' your house abounds with all good things?_ 
> And having turn to SImon, his disciple, who sat next him, _Simon, thou son of Johanna_, said he, _it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven._ 
> _Ebion_ alter this passage of the gospel, because he did not acknowledge Christ to be the sone of God, not a law-giver, but a bare interprete of the law which was given _Moses_. _Grotius_ $\frac{336}{1060}$

**Hereticks**  
> _Noftrum igitur fuit eligere &amp; optare meliora, ut ad veftram correctionem aditum baberemus_.
> _Augustinus Tom_. VI. Col. 116. _fol_. _Basile&aelig;_ 1543 _contra Epist. Manich&aelig;i, quam vocant Fundamenti_.
> "We believed that other methods ought to be taken, in order to make you retract your erros;
> affronts and invctives are by all means to be avoided, ill usage and persecution are never likely to succeed;
> but the only way to draw you is by kind discourses and exhortations, which may demonstrate our tender concern fro you; 
> according to that of the scripture, a servant of the lord ought not to be quarrelsom, but gentle to all men;
> apt to teach, patient, and with modesty, to reprove those that are not like-minded.
> Let those persons rigorously treat you, who know not how difficult it is to come to the knowledge of truth, and to avoid errors.
> Let those persons rigorously treat you, who know not how hard a matter it is, and how seldom effected, to cause carnal imagination to give way to spiritual and pious one.
> Let those persons rigorously treat you, who are not sensible of the extreame difficulties that there are to purify the eye of the inward man, in order to make it capable of perceiving truth, which is the _Sun_ of the soul. \[20]
> Let"

**Confession of Faith**  
> _Periculosum nobis admodum atque etiam miserabile est, tot nunc fides existere, quot voluntates; &amp; tot nobis doctinas esse quot mortes, etc_. 
> _Hilarius_, p. 211. _in Lib. ad Constantium Augustum. Basil._ 1570 _Fol._
> It is a thing both deplorable and dangerous, that there are now as many confessions of faith as there are wills, as many opinions as inclinations, and as many sources of blasphemy as there a vices, whilst we make as many confessions of faith as we please, and gloss upon them as we think fit.
> And as there is but One God, One Lord, and One Baptism, so there is but One Faith, which One Faith we renounce when we make many different confessions;
> and certainly this diversity, is the cause that there is no more true faith to be found.
> We are convinced, that after the Council at _Nice_ there was nothing, either on one side of t'other, but writing confessions of faith.
> And while they contend about words, while they dispute about equivocal terms, while they complain of authors, while every body endeavours to advance his own party, while no one can agree, \[24] 

**Hereticks**  
> Let those persons rigorously treat you, who know not how many sighs and groans, it costs before one can attain to any small knowledge of the divine being.
> Finally, let those persons rigorously treat you, who were never seduced by such errors as they see you have been deceived by.
> I pass by that most pure wisdom, to the knowledge of which very few spiritual persons arrive at in this life;
> yet although they it but in very small measure, because they are men, yet they know it without doubting.
> For in the Catholic Church it is not penetration of wit, nor depth of knowledge, but the simplicity of the faith, which makes people sure and safe.
>
> _Barbari quippe homines Roman&aelig;, imo potius humane eruditionis expertes, qui nihiul omnino sciunt, nisi quod a Doctoribus suis audiunt;
> quod audiunt hoc sequuntus, etc. Salvanius_ $\frac{162}{249}$.
> The sense of which take as follows.
> This Bishop speaking of the _Arian Goths_ and _Vandals_, they are a barbarous people, says he, who have not any taste of the _Roman_ learning, and who are ignorant even of those things with which almost all the rest of mankin are acquainted;
> they know nothing but what they have learnt from their Doctors, and mind nothing but what they have heard from them.
> Whence people so ignorant as these
