### Wrandom Writing 

> #### Cognitive Loading in Battle
> 
> We present here findings of the Johannesberg Defence Research Agency which conducted a cognitive behavioural treatment in 432 airbourne service personnel from a single battalion.
> 
> In this personnel we induced depressive type symptoms while maintaining motivation. We found these personnel to undergo less cognitive changes before and after violent combat activities compared to other battalions. This occurred without any measurable reduction in combat effectiveness. #world-anvil
