#  Wednesday; Week  09

- What excited me today?
	- I was actually kind of excited to do admissions today. That excitement certainly drained after the first few phone calls. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- The key interaction was about the nursing home chap with metastatic cancer. The residents just don't have any experience with inpatient medicine. They seem to have a present script in their minds and if I ask a question like _"what will I do for this patient?"_, all they can answer with their obs and results. There's no synthesis. I shouldn't have admitted that patient honestly 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that I can actually get an afterhours MRI, or at least a late evening MRI after closing time. I'm actually kind of proud of being able to organise that so quickly, and without having to blow anyone.
