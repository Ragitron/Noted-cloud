#  Saturday; Week  08

## Today's Takeaway

[Calisthenics for Complete Beginners](../../../Journal/Exercise/calisthenics.md) #review

***

Today I was excited to try the food at the cafe at the floor of the [CBD apartments](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kRjCqm2UJ8qqqWmL6). I was not disappointed.

Ruminating on all the things I wanted to do was draining, and I ended not doing anything.

Reading Hannah Arendt's book I learned about the distinct nature of French antisemitism to the antisemetism that would follow in the 20th century.
