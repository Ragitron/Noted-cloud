#  Monday; Week  09

- What excited me today?
	- I was kind of excited to see the team again, I was really keen to try an new approach to the residents. Try and express my enthusiasm to work with them, rather than be my usual persona of restrained gloom. 
	- I was also pretty excited to try the addition of calisthenics to my morning workout. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- Sorting through the mess of paperwork that is the med clinic was draining. Most of my clinic seems to be just trying to figure what particular problem I'm trying to chase down. 
	- I'm hoping that doing letters for everyone will start to make it clear, at least for the next registrar.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that alteplase isn't as much harmful after 4.5 of stroke onset as it *not beneficial*, at least according to [^Emberson J, Lees KR, Lyden P, et al. Effect of treatment delay, age, and stroke severity on the effects of intravenous thrombolysis with alteplase for acute ischaemic stroke: a meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials. _Lancet_. 2014;384(9958):1929-1935. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(14)60584-5], although this study is now a bit long in the tooth, and the stroke guideline clearly suggests increased mortality risk.
