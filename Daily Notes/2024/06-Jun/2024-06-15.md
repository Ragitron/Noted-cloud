#  Saturday; Week  24



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to do games with the boys and I wasn't disappointed. Although the game got a bit frustrating. Its always nice to catch up with them. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- _Arma_ antistasi was again a bit draining. I'm finding it too slow at the end game, there's little for me to do except wait for my troops to simply roll over enemy positions. If the game was more like say _Helldivers_, where I get some random objectives that if successful push the frontline that would be good. I very much don't enjoy the command layer in _Arma_, its like trying to give orders to a body of water.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that the G7 is giving _Ukraine_ a &dollar; 50B "loan" which is apparently the interest on the &dollar;300B that was held from Russia. But if that's the case why should it be a loan. Who is the loan being paid back to?
