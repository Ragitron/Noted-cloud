#  Thursday; Week  25

Today I left at 1800

### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to manage the man with the pleural effusion. I would have preferred to try and organise a tunneled IPC but the ICC is fine. Its just upsetting that ED would put so many barriers to our management of our patient. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- Staying back late was a bit draining.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned about _jus ad bellum_ and _jus in bello_ as defined by the ICRC, the former being the justification of war (the _casus belli_?) and the latter being the conduct of war, and what is synonymous with International Humanitarian law.


## TASKS

- [x] need to grab a PICC from ICU to give CQR that lady [due::2024-06-20T11:50] [done::204-06-20T10:45]
