# Wednesday; Week 25



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to see the _cauda equina_ patient today. It wasn't as exciting as I had hoped since their neurology isn't that dramatic, and in all honesty I think its more constipation than anything else. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- There was nothing in particular, but it was draining trying to coral the radiology department to give me a definite timetable on my lady's PICC insertion.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that there is in fact a PICC service provided by CQR with dedicated nursing staff to ultrasound guided IV access.
