#  Thursday; Week  24



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today? 
	- I was excited to do some world building today, and I spent most of that time writing table top rules and re-organising my world-building vault. I remember these same rules from years ago, when I was still in Uni I had come up with this table top game that wouldn't rely on dice rolls. Most of that detail is somehow still in my head. 
- What drained me of energy? 
	- Arma actually drained me a bit today. I still enjoy it, I still want it, but assaulting another outpost in Antistasi is starting to wear me down. And I didn't dive into any FromSoftware stuff believing that I would eventually go out. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that there's a schizophrenic on the internet that believes that Warhammer 40K is "_dieselpunk_". Which I can see a superficial resemblence, but this feels more like trying to create a definition for dieselpunk buy squinting at an aesthetic. 
	- I think _dieselpunk_ really isn't its own thing yet, its more an offshoot of steampunk. Although I will agree that there's an element of anti-fascism to dieselpunk.
