#  Sunday; Week  25



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- Once the admissions were done and I had some free time I was actually a bit excited to review my flashcards for the first time in what must be a year. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- I was bit miffed that my patient transferred without my notes to the peripheral hospital. And similarly I wasn't particularly excited to receive a handover that didn't seem to add anything to my understanding of the patient other than the fact they had AF.  
		- I had already seen the patient on the ramp and knew they had left upper limb weakness and left shoulder pain, and that the weakness had been present for some days. The referral didn't include much other information and I had already seen the CT report before the referrer, so he was saying 'when the report comes back', and I knew what the report says. 
		- In hindsight I probs should have just say 'the reports back bro'.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned to navigate Alex's rostering spreadsheet a bit more. 
	- I also learned about a platelet coombs test for ITP.
