> _Jus ad bellum_ refers to the conditions under which States may resort to war or to the use of armed force in general. 
> The prohibition against the use of force amongst States and the exceptions to it (self-defence and UN
authorization for the use of force), set out in the United Nations Charter of 1945, are the core ingredients of jus ad bellum (see the box titled "On the Prohibition against War"). 
> _Jus in bello_ regulates the conduct of parties engaged in an armed conflict. IHL is synonymous with _jus in bello_; 
> it seeks to minimize suffering in armed conflicts, notably by protecting and assisting all victims of armed conflict to the greatest extent possible.
