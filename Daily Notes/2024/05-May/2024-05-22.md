#  Wednesday; Week  21



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to see what the case presentation would be about. It turned out to be a case of thyrotoxicosis. Pretty basic but a classic presentation. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- I can't think of anything specific, I feel very tired even at 1900. Today is my wash day where I don't restrict my weekday gaming but I haven't dived into it as much. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that &beta;-2-Microglobulin can be used for staging of lymphoma. 

I also had a good conversation with Shiromali today. I mentioned my thoughts about moving to Perth, she suggested completing my exams first so that I don't have to learn a completely new health system while also trying to prepare for exams. Its good #advice.
