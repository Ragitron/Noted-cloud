#  Wednesday; Week  28


When asked what do you want to be when you grow up, no child has ever dreamt of  being a nuisance to 911 or an Ed frequent flyer. 

I’m a doc that is always angry no matter the reason when hospital staff, emts… make fun of patients for coming in. Yes there are other Critical patients that are more pressing but it’s not that patients fault. It’s the fault of government/administration that despite everyone knowing there will be too many critical and non critical patients for that staff that are booked, they don’t employ more. We pay enough for healthcare, this can be found in the budget. 

Don’t even get me started on people that don’t do a work up or exam on the patient that is annoying/hostile because it gets labeled as psych or addiction immediately. The not my problem mentality needs to end. It very clearly is our problem. 

Hr in the 150s very well could be svt or so many other non-benign rhythms that resolved but still needs further investigation (whether urgently or not). You should not have been saying “fuck have I become one of those patients”, you should be saying “fuck is that how I treat those patients? I need to change”
