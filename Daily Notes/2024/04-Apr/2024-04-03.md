### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was really excited to see the patient with a pericardial and pleural effusions. In the end the effusions weren't that bad and the pericardial effusion was barely present. Even the gall bladder mass she was illusory which was good for her, but upsetting nonetheless.
- What drained me of energy?
	- The entire day was draining, particularly taking the external referrals. I really feel that these should be directly to the consultant, particularly if the expectation is that all of them should be discussed with the consultant. Why waste every bodies time. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned there's a new ED resident or registrar (not sure she seems reasonably smart, maybe the latter). She's probably interstate.
