#  Tuesday; Week  10



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to explore my new place today. I'm not disappointed. The place is much bigger than any place I've been to before. But still a bit tight. The corridors are tight and twister, shelves are hidden behind bulkheads, but there's plenty of surface area. I'm going to hate cleaning this place... #prediction
- What drained me of energy?
	- I spent most of the day anxiously trying to fit my trip to get the house keys into my afternoon. Trying to run back and forth in a vain attempt to get everything done in order to clear the ground so that I could leave the hospital for an hour without worrying that things will burn down. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that thyroid receptor agonists are being trialled for a diverse host of different indications. #review
