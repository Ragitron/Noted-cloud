#  Wednesday; Week  11

Left adrenal adenoma  
063676 


### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was really excited to go to trivia and see people outside the hospital. It was fun but there only two people there. Which ordinarily wouldn't bother me, but I kind of wanted there to be more so that me being quiet wouldn't be as notable. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- There was nothing particularly draining. I had another interaction with cardiology PHO but it was okay. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned the flowchart for assessing an incidental adrenal adenoma. Starting with a dexamethasone suppression test and then determining if there is any radiologically sinister signs. The size fulcrum for concern appears to be 4 cm.
