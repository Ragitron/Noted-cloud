#  Friday; Week  13



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
- What drained me of energy?
- What did I learn?
	- Today I learned about the conjunction fallacy described by the economist Kahnemann and exampled by the 'Linda the Bank Teller' case. The case itself I don't feel proves a conjunction fallacy as the wording leads participates to make conclusions based on implied information.
