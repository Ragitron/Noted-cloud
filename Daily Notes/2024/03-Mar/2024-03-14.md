#  Thursday; Week  11



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was actually really excited in handover to see the new stroke patient. I really wanted to find out what their presentation was and actually examine their neurology. 
	- I got a little bit of the former, and almost none of the latter. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- Clinic was yet again draining. I can't really see a patient in 20 minutes, and talk to the consultant, and write up the referrals, and make sure my notes are at least coherent, even if incomplete. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned to think about alternatives first before concluding lung cancer when confronted with a new lung lesion. It certainly looks sinister, but the rest of the story makes little sense. Without any clear smoking history the possibility that lesion is actually a secondary and not a primary goes up.
