#  Monday; Week  11



### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to return to work, see my resident, catch up with the patients. It wasn't as interesting as I had hoped however. One of the patients had died over the weekend, and I think it was obvious before the weekend. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- Clinic was far too draining today. There were simply too many patients to try to get through in 2 hours. For six patients, that's only 20 minutes each, if I don't read up on each of them in between. 
- What did I learn?
	- I learned that captopril and enalapril are the only ACEi that are considered safe for breastfeeding.
