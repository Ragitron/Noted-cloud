### Today's Thoughts

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited to complete some letters. Which I managed to do for some of them but then actual work got in the way. 
- What drained me of energy?
	- Trying to navigate the politics of the hospitals was exhausting, even after trying to help I feel like I fucked up everything. I feel that either external calls should just go straight through to the consultant like at SCUH where the geographic spread is similar. Half my phonecalls are about transfers from other hospitals, there's an argument to be made that the Registrar is there to triage those referrals, but they've already been triaged, they aren't usually calling because they don't know what to do, they're calling because they've done all they can.
- What did I learn?
	- I learned
