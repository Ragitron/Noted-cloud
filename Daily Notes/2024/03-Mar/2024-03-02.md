#  Saturday; Week  09

- What excited me today?
	- I was excited for a day of admitting actually. Without the stress of having the team do rounds without me and be understaffed I could simply focus on the admissions. Luckily there wasn't that much pressure with workload. Although there were a few admissions that I think I could have figured out how to get home.  
- What drained me of energy?
	- Its hard to think of something that was specifically draining. 
	- Sitting in the emergency department to finish my notes and having nurses and doctors interrupt me to try to refer, or ask something dumb, was rather draining.  
- What did I learn? 
	- I learned why the Rockhampton doesn't do lysis anymore and its more or less what I had expected.
