# 5 ways the EU could help end the war in Ukraine

1. Fixing the oil price cap 
      - by closing the loophole currently used by countries such as India, Turkiye, and China
      - *the article fails to suggest a feasible way the EU could close these loopholes*
      - *don't know if the implication that US wants the loopholes open is valid* 
2. Banning Russian metal imports 
      - currently aluminium and pig iron continue to make their way out of Russia
       - countries such as Belgium and Czechia (or at least companies within them) continue to lobby against such a ban
3. Banning imports of Russian Gas 
       - LNG continues to move across the Russian border, with many countries increasing their supply, or locked into long-term contracts 
4. Closing Loopholes
       - currently "dual-use" goods move from the west across alternative trade routes in countries such as Kazakhstan, Armenia, and Georgia 
       - *although the article doesn't discuss a potential Russian escalation if the collective west starts fingering its little cousins; not that Russian escalation means much these days* 
5. Banning Russian nuclear imports 
       - Russian continues to provide "fuel and services" to the EU in the nuclear energy sector (via Rosatom); a potential source of Russian soft power, if not monetary gain
